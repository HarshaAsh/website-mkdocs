Saaty, is designed to solve complex multi-criteria decision problems. AHP requires the decision maker to provide judgments about the relative importance of each criterion and then specify a preference for each decision alternative using each criterion. The output of AHP is a prioritized ranking of the decision alternatives based on the overall preferences expressed by the decision maker. To introduce AHP I want to consider a purchasing problem I have faced recently. I had to buy a new phone, so I went to a nearby mall. After searching in a lot of stores, I have narrowed down my list to the below 4 phones. The following criteria are relevant in my selection of phone (in the order of importance): 1. Battery 2. Price 3. Performance 4. Reviews 5. Recency 6. Display 7. Radiation 8. Brand 9. Camera Data regarding reviews, price and battery is simple. But some other factors are subjective like brand and display. The advantage of AHP is that it can handle situations in which the unique subjective judgments of the individual decision maker constitute an important part of the decision-making process. Developing the Hierarchy \u00b6 The first step in AHP is to develop a graphical representation of the problem in terms of the overall goal, the criteria to be used, and the decision alternatives. Such a graph depicts the hierarchy for the problem. Using AHP, I will specify the relative importance of each of the nine criteria in terms of its contribution to the achievement of the overall goal. At the next level, I will indicate a preference for each decision alternative based on each criterion. Finally, the information is synthesized on the relative importance of the criteria and the preferences for the decision alternatives to provide an overall priority ranking of the decision alternatives. Establishing priorities using AHP \u00b6 AHP uses pairwise comparison matrix to show the priorities of a decision. This will measure the relative degree to which each option of the pair accomplishes this specific criterion. It is a square nxn matrix, where N is the number of options that we have, in this case 9. The values of this matrix should be filled using the following scale. Pairwise Comparisons \u00b6 In establishing the priorities for the nine criteria, I will give a score to each criterion relative to each other criterion when the criteria are compared two at a time (pairwise) using the above scale. Performance is further divided into Processor, Max-Speed and Storage. Similarly, Camera and Display are also further divided. The pairwise comparison matrices for Performance, Camera and Display are as follows: Synthesization \u00b6 The priorities for each of the criterion are obtained by the eigenvalues of the PCM matrix. The priorities of each of the criterion are as follows: Combining the above priorities, the priority for the factor Inches of display is the priority of display * priority of Inch = 0.05*0.666 = 0.033. Comparison of each criterion \u00b6 A Pairwise comparison matrix comparing phones is generated for every criterion. For example, by using Battery as a factor to understand the weights, the comparison of battery capacity between phones would be: Galaxy M30s > Oppo A9 2020> Vivo S1 > Redmi Note 7 Pro . The difference between Samsung Galaxy M30s and Oppo A9 is around 1000MAh but the difference between Vivo S1 and RedmiNote7 Pro is only 500MAh. This is captured in the pairwise comparison matrix: Similar matrices are created for each of the other metrics. Overall Priority Ranking \u00b6 The procedure used to compute the overall priority is to weight each phone\u2019s weight (shown for factor Battery above) by the corresponding criterion priority. For example, the phone Vivo S1 has a weight of 0.20 for battery while the factor Battery has a priority of 0.31. The total priority would be 0.2*0.31 = 0.061 for battery of Vivo S1. To obtain the overall priority of the Vivo S1 , we need to make similar computations for all the other criteria and then add the values for that particular item to obtain the overall priority. The overall priority ranking of all the phones is: From the overall priority, I will select Vivo S1. A different person who might give different weights or priorities would choose a different phone. AHP is used in many places for taking decisions which have many criteria. It is used extensively in NASA, XEROX, Walmart, US Navy, IBM etc. It can be used for selecting among different choices, prioritization, resource allocation, bench-marking, quality management etc. Refer The Analytic Hierarchy Process \u2013 An Exposition for more.

Below is my experience at the part-time (on-campus) BAI executive course from IIM Bangalore. I will talk about the course content, peers, campus, lecturers, ROI and alumni connections. Applying and getting in \u00b6 The first round of selection was an MCQ based test containing mathematics and statistics questions(like CAT but with more focus on statistics). Then there was a face to face interview with a professor from IIMB. Apart from some simple statistics, the professor asked a couple of data-science related questions like assumptions of linear regression. They had asked some questions about my work experience too. A case study was presented, and I had to explain how I would approach the problem. After a few days, I got the result saying that I was selected for the programme. Course Content \u00b6 I was already working on Machine learning and data science projects at Mu-Sigma. I had a general understanding of Hypothesis testing, prediction, machine learning etc. After looking at the contents, I was initially sceptical about whether I can learn anything new from this programme or something that I couldn't get through a couple of Coursera courses. After completing the course, I can see certain benefits from this programme in terms of content. This course starts with the basics of statistics and then goes all the way to machine learning and deep learning. It has structured learning which is holistic. For example, I would have never learnt anything about Stochastic models, operational analytics or optimisation techniques if I was learning on my own or through Coursera. Although I had thought that I knew hypothesis testing, prediction and other machine learning topics before, I realised that I did not know their inner workings or know their assumptions or limitations. This course goes into the basics and emphasises the first principles. The schedule of the course is designed optimally for part-time learning. I was able to implement some of the concepts that I learnt here in real-time at Mu-Sigma. For example, I would learn about optimisation this week, and next week I would start a POC at Mu-Sigma based on it. By the time the POC is complete, I would have classes for the next module. This real-time implementation helped me a lot. The assignments come a month after the lectures which reinforce the learning. It's a balanced course with more emphasis on business and statistics and a lesser emphasis on coding and technology. Overall the course brings a blend of business, statistics and technology in a way very few courses do (even full-time courses). On the other hand, the course is very rigorous and for many students balancing a full-time job, and home, and a rigorous curriculum like this one might be difficult. Also, as this course is geared towards executives, it is not so focussed on the coding part, although sufficient lectures and material are provided for the same. Peers \u00b6 The most significant advantage of this course is its peers. I might find the best lecturers and excellent content elsewhere in the country too. I might not find 60 individuals who are working in data science and business analytics (and allied fields) at senior positions with an average of ~ ten years of experience who have the drive and motivation to learn. I am honoured to be a part of the BAI 10 batch and study with PhD's, Directors, CEO's and highly experienced people. The diversity and experience that they bring to the classroom are unparalleled. I would learn more during lunch with my peers than I would in the weeks following it. Campus \u00b6 IIMB campus is very famous for its natural beauty. It's the Three-Idiots campus. I can go on and on about it, so ill stop it here. The accommodation at the campus is costly, and there is no point in staying at the hostel (for part-time students). Even for students who reside in Bangalore, travel to and from college in the famed 'Bangalore traffic' is a major issue. My advice is to take a room at nearby hotels during class days to reduce travel and concentrate on studying. There were technical issues during the live-streaming of classes that affected some online students. I think they will be addressed now with their experience of doing completely online courses during COVID-19. Lecturers \u00b6 Dinesh Sir and Rajaluxmi Madam are the programme directors, and they took the majority content of the programme. While they generally discuss the basics and the foundational topics, other experienced lecturers either from IIMB or from the industry go into the applications, or in-depth into specific topics. Industry experts teach more advanced and industry-related topics. Overall it's a well-rounded and experienced team. Alumni-connects \u00b6 As we were the tenth batch, we had a strong alumni network which I had leveraged while applying for jobs. Some alumni also come back to give lectures on the work they do at their companies which is very useful. DCAL lab (associated with IIMB) has frequent workshops and symposiums where the alumni can connect. Being a part of the greater IIMB alumni is an added advantage. ROI \u00b6 The fees during my time were around seven lakhs. I would have spent an additional one lakh on travel, accommodation, food and miscellaneous. So my investment is around eight lakhs, along with weekends and some weekdays. The benefits I got were immense. My salary after the course is three times the salary before the course(my initial base was smaller). I have leveraged these learnings and the IIM brand to apply for Masters in the top 20 universities in the world. Capstone \u00b6 The final project I did was with one of the leading life insurance companies in India. It was a real-world problem that had no obvious data-based solution. I was able to understand how to convert a vague business problem to a solvable data science problem. The solution required multidimensional thinking, and I learnt a lot from my teammates. With the help of our mentor, Srilatha madam, we were able to implement and give a reasonable solution to the business. I hope we did a positive impact on the business of the insurance company. Our project was highly appreciated and got awards.

In this post, I would like to give an introduction to human neurons and a comparison to ANN. Using a single-layered perceptron model, I will try to solve a linearly separable problem. Artificial neural networks are the backbone of artificial intelligence and deep learning. They are versatile and scalable, making them ideal for tackling complex tasks like image classification, speech recognition, recommendation systems and natural language processing. Biological vs Artificial Neurons \u00b6 We are trying to imitate the functioning of the brain. Although we don't exactly know what exactly happens in the brain, we have a basic understanding. We are trying to approximate it using mathematical functions. The human brain has billions of neurons. In humans, neurons are a network of 100 million neurons and 60 trillion connections. If each neuron is approximated to a computing unit, this cannot be replicated currently by computers. In the human brain, a neuron consists of different parts: Soma: The cell body (Approximated to the neuron in ANN) Dendrites: Input to the cell (Approximated to the input) Synopses: It is the weight assigned to the input (Approximated to the weight or slope) Axon: Output to a neuron (Approximated to the final output) What happens in a neuron? \u00b6 When a neuron receives signals from different dendrites, the signals are cumulated. In a simplified understanding, if this cumulated signal is greater than a certain value, it passes these signals to the next neuron. Neuron, when it communicates with neighbouring neurons, it uses electrochemical reactions which are approximated to a mathematical function called the activation function. In humans, neurons have computing powers as well as cognition powers. Also, the human brain neural network is plastic, which means, some neurons die, new neurons are created, the synapses change, etc. [1] How do we approximate it to an ANN \u00b6 In an Artificial neuron, the soma is approximated to the neuron. The dendrites are the input function, the synapses are the weights and the Axon is approximated to an output. A representation of a neuron (also called TLU) is below: Activation function: In biological systems, the neurons transmit signals after they reach some threshold potential. The below figure shows how the neuron transmits the signal only after the signal is greater than the threshold potential. In ANN, this is mathematically represented using an activation function. Please see this link for understanding: Action potential propagation Perceptron \u00b6 The perceptron is the simplest ANN architecture. A perceptron contains a single layer of TLU(Threshold Logical Units). The input and outputs are numbers, and each of the inputs has a weight. A weighted sum of the inputs is computed (z), and then an activation function is applied to get the result (y). $$ z = w_1 \\times x_1 + w_2 \\times x_2 ... w_n \\times x_n $$ In the current example, the step function is the activation function. If the data is mutually separable, a step function is sufficient for classification problems. \\[ step(z) =\\begin{cases} -1 & z < \\theta \\\\ 0 & z = \\theta \\\\ 1 & z > \\theta \\end{cases} \\] Also, ANNs are models from where simple business understandable rules cannot be generated, which creates a reluctance for its widespread use when other explainable models can be used. A perceptron model has four steps: Step 1: Set initial weights \\(w_1, w_2 ... w_n\\) and threshold \\(\\theta\\) (bias). We generally take small values between [-0.5, 0.5] Step 2: Identify the activation function Step 3: Weight training: Weight is updated based on error: The weight correction is done based on the error. The weight in node i is the previous weight plus an additional correction. This correction is a product of learning rate, input value and error. $$ w_i(p+1) = w_i(p) + \\delta w_i(p) $$ $$ \\delta w_i(p) = \\alpha \\times x_i(p) \\times e(p) $$ Where \\(w_i(p)\\) is the weight at step p correction and \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate. Step 4: Repeat till stopping criterion Even with such a simple model, we can train the model to perform logical computations like or-gate . The input and output for an and-gate are as follows: # Loading packages and initialising import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt np . random . seed ( 42 ) num_inputs = 4 dimension = 2 alpha = 0.1 input 1 input 2 output 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 input_array = np . array ([ [ 0 , 0 ], [ 0 , 1 ], [ 1 , 0 ], [ 1 , 1 ], ]) output_array = np . array ([ 0 , 1 , 1 , 1 ]) A single-layer simple TLU is taken to solve this problem. Step 1: \u00b6 Randomly choosing weights of \\(w_{1,3} = 0.49\\) , \\(w_{2,3} = -0.13\\) , # randomly initialize the weights weight = np . random . randn ( dimension ) weight array([ 0.49671415, -0.1382643 ]) Step 2: \u00b6 The activation function is the step function which is described above. $$ step(z) =\\begin{cases} 0 & z \\leq 0 \\ 1 & z > 0 \\end{cases} $$ For the above weights, The output for the four scenarios is: Output for epoch 1 input 1 ($I_1$) input 2 ($I_2$) $w_{1,3}$ $w_{2,3}$ input to N3 output ($O_3$) 0 0 0.49 -0.13 0 0 0 1 0.49 -0.13 0*0.49+1*(-0.13) = -0.13 step(-0.13)=0 1 0 0.49 -0.13 1*0.49+0*(-0.13) = 0.49 step(0.49) = 1 1 1 0.49 -0.13 1*0.49+1*(-0.13) = 0.36 step(0.36) = 1 model_output = input_array . dot ( weight ) y_pred = np . heaviside ( model_output , 0 ) y_pred array([0., 0., 1., 1.]) Step 3: \u00b6 Weight training: Weight is updated based on error: The weight correction is done based on the error. The weight in node i is the previous weight plus an additional correction. This correction is a product of learning rate, input value and error. $$ w_i(p+1) = w_i(p) + \\delta w_i(p) $$ $$ \\delta w_i(p) = \\alpha \\times x_i(p) \\times e(p) $$ Where \\(w_i(p)\\) is the weight at step p correction and \\(\\alpha\\) is the learning rate. assuming a \\(\\alpha=0.1\\) , we have the following values Error for epoch 1 input 1 ($I_1$) input 2 ($I_2$) Pred ($O_3$) Actual output Error ($\\epsilon$) $\\delta w_{1,3}$ $\\delta w_{2,3}$ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 $\\delta w_{1,3}(2) = \\alpha \\times I_1(2) \\times e(2) = 0.1\\times 0\\times 1 = 0$ $\\delta w_{2,3}(2) = \\alpha \\times I_2(2) \\times e(2) = 0.1\\times 1\\times 1 = 0.1$ 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 Therefore the updated weights are \\(w_{1,3} = 0.49, w_{2,3} = -0.03\\) weight + alpha * input_array . T . dot ( output_array - y_pred ) array([ 0.49671415, -0.0382643 ]) Step 4 \u00b6 One such iteration is called an epoch.

In the human brain, a neuron consists of different parts: Soma: The cell body (Approximated to the neuron in ANN) Dendrites: Input to the cell (Approximated to the input) Synopses: It is the weight assigned to the input (Approximated to the weight or slope) Axon: Output to a neuron (Approximated to the final output)","title":"Biological vs Artificial Neurons"},{"location":"Python/ANN-1/#what-happens-in-a-neuron","text":"When a neuron receives signals from different dendrites, the signals are cumulated.

A perceptron contains a single layer of TLU(Threshold Logical Units). The input and outputs are numbers, and each of the inputs has a weight. A weighted sum of the inputs is computed (z), and then an activation function is applied to get the result (y). $$ z = w_1 \\times x_1 + w_2 \\times x_2 ... w_n \\times x_n $$ In the current example, the step function is the activation function. If the data is mutually separable, a step function is sufficient for classification problems. \\[ step(z) =\\begin{cases} -1 & z < \\theta \\\\ 0 & z = \\theta \\\\ 1 & z > \\theta \\end{cases} \\] Also, ANNs are models from where simple business understandable rules cannot be generated, which creates a reluctance for its widespread use when other explainable models can be used. A perceptron model has four steps: Step 1: Set initial weights \\(w_1, w_2 ... w_n\\) and threshold \\(\\theta\\) (bias). We generally take small values between [-0.5, 0.5] Step 2: Identify the activation function Step 3: Weight training: Weight is updated based on error: The weight correction is done based on the error. The weight in node i is the previous weight plus an additional correction.

As discussed in the previous blog[], unit root stochastic process is another name for Random walk process. A random walk process can be written as $$ Y_t=\\rho \\times Y_{t\u22121} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\rho = 1\\) . If \\(|\\rho|<1\\) then the process represents Markov first order auto regressive model which is stationary. Only for \\(\\rho=1\\) we get non-stationary. The above equation can be alternatively written as $$ Y_t - Y_{t-1} = \\Delta Y_t = \\delta \\times Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\delta = \\rho -1\\) . For non-stationarity, the condition now becomes \\(\\delta = 0\\) the alternative hypothesis being \\(\\delta < 0\\) . The null and alternate hypothesis are: \\(H_0: \\delta = 0\\) (Time series is non-stationary) \\(H_1 : \\delta < 0\\) (Time series is stationary) Under this null hypothesis, \\(Y_{t-1}\\) does not follow a normal distribution(or t-distribution). Dickey and Fuller have shown that for the above null and alternate hypothesis, the estimated test statistic follows the \\(\\tau\\) statistic. If the hypothesis that \\(\\delta=0\\) is rejected, that is if the series is stationary, then we can use the t-test for further analysis. For the data, the Dickey Fuller tests give the following results from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import adfuller , kpss result = adfuller ( data . pm25 ) print ( 'ADF Statistic: %f ' % result [ 0 ]) print ( 'p-value: %f ' % result [ 1 ]) print ( 'Critical Values:' ) for key , value in result [ 4 ] . items (): print ( ' \\t %s : %.3f ' % ( key , value )) ADF Statistic: -3.835594 p-value: 0.002563 Critical Values: 1%: -3.433 5%: -2.863 10%: -2.567 # KPSS Test result = kpss ( data . pm25 . values , regression = 'c' ) print ( ' \\n KPSS Statistic: %f ' % result [ 0 ]) print ( 'p-value: %f ' % result [ 1 ]) for key , value in result [ 3 ] . items (): print ( 'Critial Values:' ) print ( f ' { key } , { value } ' ) KPSS Statistic: 1.318795 p-value: 0.010000 Critial Values: 10%, 0.347 Critial Values: 5%, 0.463 Critial Values: 2.5%, 0.574 Critial Values: 1%, 0.739 As the p-value is less than the cut-off (5%), we reject the Null hypothesis. The time series is stationary. ACF and PACF plots \u00b6 from statsmodels.graphics.tsaplots import plot_acf , plot_pacf print ( plot_acf ( data . pm25 )) print ( plot_pacf ( data . pm25 )) This indicates that the data is stationary. Another way to verify this is using the pdarima library to identify the lag at which the data will be stationary using adf, kpss and pp tests.

This makes sense as any air pollutant generally stays in the air for a maximum of two days for Hyderabad wind and climatic patterns. So the effect of any sudden increase or decrease in pollutants (MA Component) exists for a day in the future. Also, the pollution today is effected by the baseline pollution in the last two days (AR component). # Predicting on the complete data (test + train) from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA model_arima = ARIMA ( data . pm25 , order = ( 2 , 0 , 1 )) results_AR = model_arima . fit ( disp =- 1 ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 16 , 12 ), dpi = 80 ) plt . plot ( data . date , data . pm25 ) plt . plot ( data . date , results_AR . fittedvalues , color = 'red' , alpha = 0.9 ) plt . title ( \"Actual vs predicted for PM 25 in Hyderabad\" , fontsize = 20 ) plt . show () From the residuals we can see no patterns, indicating that we have a good prediction. print ( model . plot_diagnostics ( figsize = ( 20 , 10 ))) In the next blogs, we will implement deep learning (Like LSTM, RNN) and other methods on this data to deploy multiple models using various deployment methodologies.

As discussed in the previous blog[], unit root stochastic process is another name for Random walk process. A random walk process can be written as $$ Y_t=\\rho \\times Y_{t\u22121} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\rho = 1\\) . If \\(|\\rho|<1\\) then the process represents Markov first order auto regressive model which is stationary. Only for \\(\\rho=1\\) we get non-stationary. The above equation can be alternatively written as $$ Y_t - Y_{t-1} = \\Delta Y_t = \\delta \\times Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\delta = \\rho -1\\) . For non-stationarity, the condition now becomes \\(\\delta = 0\\) the alternative hypothesis being \\(\\delta < 0\\) . The null and alternate hypothesis are: \\(H_0: \\delta = 0\\) (Time series is non-stationary) \\(H_1 : \\delta < 0\\) (Time series is stationary) Under this null hypothesis, \\(Y_{t-1}\\) does not follow a normal distribution(or t-distribution). Dickey and Fuller have shown that for the above null and alternate hypothesis, the estimated test statistic follows the \\(\\tau\\) statistic. If the hypothesis that \\(\\delta=0\\) is rejected, that is if the series is stationary, then we can use the t-test for further analysis.

While traditional AI often relies on predefined rules and static data, Agentic AI systems exhibit a higher degree of autonomy. They can independently: 1. Perceive and interpret their environment: Gather information and understand the context of a situation. 2. Make decisions: Plan and execute actions based on their goals and the perceived environment. 3. Learn and adapt: Continuously improve their performance based on past experiences and feedback. Workflows vs. Agents: \u00b6 Anthropic provides a helpful distinction between workflows and agents: Workflows : These systems are essentially automated scripts. They follow a pre-defined sequence of steps, often involving LLMs (Large Language Models) and other tools. However, their actions are largely predetermined. Agents : These are more sophisticated systems. They leverage LLMs to dynamically control their own behavior, deciding which tools to use and how to use them in the most effective way to achieve a given goal. Building an Agentic AI Tool for Blog Editing \u00b6 I want to build a tool that assists in editing my blog posts. Most of my blog posts are markdown files that have text, code, images, tables and other types of data. This tool could be an Agentic AI system that: Reads Markdown Files: Automatically processes your blog posts written in Markdown format. Identifies and Corrects Issues: Grammar and Spelling: Detects and corrects grammatical errors and misspellings. Code Verification: Analyzes and executes any code snippets within your blog posts to identify potential issues and suggest improvements. Provides Edited Output: Generates an edited version of your blog post with the corrections applied. Read the file \u00b6 I am going to implement this on the LLM Tokenizers blog which is saved as a markdown \"LLM Tokenizers.md\". file_name = 'LLM Tokenizers.md' import markdown f = open ( file_name , 'r' ) fileString = f . read () htmlmarkdown = markdown . markdown ( fileString ) print ( htmlmarkdown ) <p>Tokens are the basic unit of text in an LLM model like a word, part of a word, or punctuation. Most Generative AI models split the input data into tokens and output one token at a time. Different Generative AI models can split the same sentence into different types of tokens. This is due to three major factors:<br /> 1. Tokenisation method<br /> 2. Parameters and special tokens used to initialise the tokenizer 3. Dataset the LLM is trained on </p> <p>Let us look at a specific text and compare how different popular models split it into tokens.</p> <p>```python text = \"\"\" Harsha is a Data Scientist currently working as a Senior Consultant at Deloitte in Hyderabad, India. </p> <p>He has <span id=\"yearsofexp\">10</span> years of data science and machine learning experience.</p> <p>He built solutions for companies such as Walmart, Pepsico, Rolls-Royce, Dr-Reddys, Tesco, and Tata AIA. </p> <p>He is proficient in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PySpark and cloud platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud.</p> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> // Define a function called diff_years that calculates the difference in years between two given dates (dt2 and dt1) function diff_years(dt2, dt1) { // Calculate the difference in milliseconds between the two dates var diff = (dt2.getTime() - dt1.getTime()) / 1000; // Convert the difference from milliseconds to days diff /= (60 * 60 * 24); // Calculate the approximate number of years by dividing the difference in days by the average number of days in a year (365.25) return Math.abs(Math.round(diff / 365.25)); } dt1 = new Date(2017, 11, 4); // October 4 2017 dt2 = new Date(); // Today document.getElementById(\"yearsofexp\").innerHTML = diff_years(dt2, dt1) </script> <p>\"\"\" ```</p> <p>The above text contains the first few lines of my website. This contains conversational text, lots of company and technology names, numbers and javascript code. Let us see how different LLM's split it as tokenisors.</p> <p>```python from transformers import AutoTokenizer</p> <h1>list of colors to show text</h1> <p>colors_list = ['102;194;165', '252;141;98', '141;160;203', '231;138;195', '166;216;84', '255;217;47'] ```</p> <p><code>python def show_tokens(sentence, tokenizer_name): # Fuction that takes a sentence and tokenizer and prints the tokens tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name) token_ids = tokenizer(sentence).input_ids for i, token in enumerate(token_ids): print(f'\\x1b[0;30;48;2;{colors_list[i % len(colors_list)]}m'+ tokenizer.decode(token)+ '\\x1b[0m', end=' ')</code></p> <h2>BERT base model (uncased)</h2> <p>The Google-based <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased\">Bert model</a> was introduced in 2018 and was pre-trained in self supervised fashion (no human labels) with two objectives:<br /> 1. Masked language modelling: Model has to predict missing words between sentences<br /> 2. Next sentence prediction: Predict the next sentence<br /> The uncased model does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters. </p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"bert-base-uncased\")</code> <img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/bert uncased.jpg\" /></p> <p>We can see that the model ignores new lines and spaces used for coding and is thus not suitable for coding. Because of the absence of new lines, it can be difficult to understanding chat logs and similar texts. Some words such as \"Walmart\" are split into two tokens <em>wal</em> and <em>##mart</em>, '##' characters indicating that the token is a partial token. It does not identify company names such as \"Deloitte\" &amp; \"Tesco\" and common technology names such as \"Tableau\", \"Pyspark\". </p> <p>It starts with a [CLS] token for classification tasks and ends with a [SEP] token for the separator token. The other tokens used in the model are [PAD] padding token, [UNK] for unknown and [MASK] for masking token (used while training). </p> <h2>BERT base model (cased)</h2> <p>This model is similar to the BERT uncased model but it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters. </p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"bert-base-cased\")</code> <img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/bert cased.jpg\" /></p> <p>Tokens such as <em>consultant</em> in the uncased model have been split into <em>Consult</em> and <em>##ing</em> in the cased model. </p> <h2>GPT 2</h2> <p>OpenAI's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/openai-community/gpt2\">GPT 2</a> is a large language model built to predict the next word given all the previous words. It was built on 40GB of text and has 1.5 Billion parameters. It is trained using unsupervised unlabeled data.</p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"gpt2\")</code> <img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/GPT2.jpg\" /></p> <p>New lines are now represented in the tokenizer, along with capitalisation being preserved. Company names such as Pepsico, Rolls Royce and Deloitte are identified using multiple tokens along with common technology names such as Tableau and PySpark. The spaces used for indentation for coding are represented by one token each, and the final space is part of the next character. These whitespace characters can be useful in generating and reading code and indentation. </p> <h2>Flan-T5</h2> <p>Google's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/flan-t5\">Flan T5</a> is an encoder-decoder based model that is language-independent and trained on a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. It was built for various tasks such as translation, question/answering, sequence classification etc.</p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"google/flan-t5-base\")</code> <img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/FLAN.jpg\" /></p> <p>No newline or whitespace tokens would make it difficult to work with code. It is also unable to identify various characters and uses the unknown token /[UNK/] for the same.</p> <h2>GPT 4</h2> <p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/Xenova/gpt-4\">ChatGPT 4</a> improves on the GPT 2 model with 1.5 Billion parameters and is the most popular of all LLM models.</p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"Xenova/gpt-4\")</code></p> <p><img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/GPT 4.jpg\" /></p> <p>GPT4 tokenizer represents four spaces as a single token which helps in understanding and writing code. It has different tokens for different combinations of white spaces and tabs. It generally uses fewer tokens to represent most words. </p> <h2>Starcoder 2</h2> <p><a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/starcoder2\">Starcoder 2</a> is a 15 Billion parameter model focused on creating code. </p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"bigcode/starcoder2-15b\")</code></p> <p><img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/Statcoder 2.jpg\" /></p> <p>It identifies numbers like 2024 with four tokens, one for each number leading to a better representation of numbers and mathematics. Similar to GPT-4, it has a list of whitespaces encoded as a single token. While simple words and common nouns are represented by a number of tokens. </p> <h2>Galactica</h2> <p>Facebook's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/facebook/galactica-120b\">Galactica</a> is an LLM that is focused on scientific knowledge and is trained on many scientific papers. Its primary usage is for citation prediction, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, summarization, document generation, molecular property prediction and entity extraction.</p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"facebook/galactica-125m\")</code></p> <p><img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/Galactica.jpg\" /></p> <p>Of all the examples here, this tokenizer has the maximum number of tokens and uses multiple tokens to identify <em>javascript</em>, <em>Walmart</em>, <em>Hyderabad</em>, <em>Azure</em>, <em>Pyspark</em> etc.</p> <h2>Phi-3 (and Llama-2)</h2> <p>Microsoft's <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/microsoft/Phi-3.5-mini-instruct\">phi-3</a> reuses the tokenizer of <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\">Lamma 2</a> and adds a number of special tokens. Phi-3 models are trained using both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization and are primarily built for precise instruction adherence.<br /> Some additional special tokens such as &lt;|user|&gt;, &lt;|assistant|&gt; and,|system|&gt; are added for dealing with chat and conversations. &lt;|endoftext|&gt; is another token to denote the end of text.</p> <p><code>python show_tokens(text, \"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\")</code></p> <p><img alt=\"png\" src=\"LLM Tokenizer/Phi 2.jpg\" /></p> <p>Different tokenizers show different ways in which they tokenize the words, and this is driven largely by three factors:<br /> 1. Tokenization method: The most popular is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)<br /> 2. Tokenizing parameters: Vocabulary size, Special tokens and Capitalisation 3. Domain of the data: The tokenizer behaviour is dependent on the data on which it is trained which is chosen based on the specific use case for which it is built. We can see in the above examples how tokens are created for the same words for different tokenizers that are built to identify code, text, chat, etc.</p> <h2>References</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-large-language/9781098150952/\">Hands-On Large Language Models</a> by Jay Alammar, Maarten Grootendorst</p> Agentic tool \u00b6 Agentic AI follows a four step process. 1.

This involves identifying and categorizing different elements within the document, such as text blocks, code snippets, images, tables, and other relevant components. 2. Reasoning: Leveraging its understanding of the document's structure, the tool should intelligently determine which AI models and tools are best suited for each specific type of information. For instance, it should employ a grammar and spelling checker for text, a code checker for code blocks, etc. 3. Action: Guided by its reasoning, the tool should run the selected tools. This involves: 3.1. Grammar and Spelling Checks: Identifying and suggesting corrections for grammatical errors and misspellings within the text. 3.2.

Modify the text and merge it with the source code. Create a visual image on the changes. 3. Run the code and identify areas of improvement using LLM. If the code throws an error, identify how to solve the issue using LLM. import difflib def split_document_into_sections ( htmlmarkdown ): prompt = \"\"\" Split the document into code, text, tables, references and rest.

Most Generative AI models split the input data into tokens and output one token at a time. Different Generative AI models can split the same sentence into different types of tokens. This is due to three major factors: 1. Tokenisation method 2. Parameters and special tokens used to initialise the tokenizer 3. Dataset the LLM is trained on Let us look at a specific text and compare how different popular models split it into tokens. The above text contains the first few lines of my website. This contains conversational text, lots of company and technology names, numbers and javascript code. Let us see how different LLM's split it as tokenisors. The Google-based Bert model was introduced in 2018 and was pre-trained in self supervised fashion (no human labels) with two objectives: 1. Masked language modelling: Model has to predict missing words between sentences 2. Next sentence prediction: Predict the next sentence The uncased model does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters. We can see that the model ignores new lines and spaces used for coding and is thus not suitable for coding. Because of the absence of new lines, it can be difficult to understanding chat logs and similar texts. Some words such as \"Walmart\" are split into two tokens wal and ##mart, '##' characters indicating that the token is a partial token. It does not identify company names such as \"Deloitte\" & \"Tesco\" and common technology names such as \"Tableau\", \"Pyspark\". It starts with a [CLS] token for classification tasks and ends with a [SEP] token for the separator token. The other tokens used in the model are [PAD] padding token, [UNK] for unknown and [MASK] for masking token (used while training). This model is similar to the BERT uncased model but it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters. Tokens such as consultant in the uncased model have been split into Consult and ##ing in the cased model. OpenAI's GPT 2 is a large language model built to predict the next word given all the previous words. It was built on 40GB of text and has 1.5 Billion parameters. It is trained using unsupervised unlabeled data. New lines are now represented in the tokenizer, along with capitalisation being preserved. Company names such as Pepsico, Rolls Royce and Deloitte are identified using multiple tokens along with common technology names such as Tableau and PySpark. The spaces used for indentation for coding are represented by one token each, and the final space is part of the next character. These whitespace characters can be useful in generating and reading code and indentation. Google's Flan T5 is an encoder-decoder based model that is language-independent and trained on a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. It was built for various tasks such as translation, question/answering, sequence classification etc. No newline or whitespace tokens would make it difficult to work with code. It is also unable to identify various characters and uses the unknown token /[UNK/] for the same. ChatGPT 4 improves on the GPT 2 model with 1.5 Billion parameters and is the most popular of all LLM models. GPT4 tokenizer represents four spaces as a single token which helps in understanding and writing code. It has different tokens for different combinations of white spaces and tabs. It generally uses fewer tokens to represent most words. Starcoder 2 is a 15 Billion parameter model focused on creating code. It identifies numbers like 2024 with four tokens, one for each number leading to a better representation of numbers and mathematics. Similar to GPT-4, it has a list of whitespaces encoded as a single token. While simple words and common nouns are represented by a number of tokens. Facebook's Galactica is an LLM that is focused on scientific knowledge and is trained on many scientific papers. Its primary usage is for citation prediction, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, summarization, document generation, molecular property prediction and entity extraction. Of all the examples here, this tokenizer has the maximum number of tokens and uses multiple tokens to identify javascript, Walmart, Hyderabad, Azure, Pyspark etc. Microsoft's phi-3 reuses the tokenizer of Lamma 2 and adds a number of special tokens. Phi-3 models are trained using both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization and are primarily built for precise instruction adherence. Some additional special tokens such as <|user|>, <|assistant|> and,|system|> are added for dealing with chat and conversations. <|endoftext|> is another token to denote the end of text. Different tokenizers show different ways in which they tokenize the words, and this is driven largely by three factors: 1. Tokenization method: The most popular is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) 2. Tokenizing parameters: Vocabulary size, Special tokens and Capitalisation 3. Domain of the data: The tokenizer behaviour is dependent on the data on which it is trained which is chosen based on the specific use case for which it is built. We can see in the above examples how tokens are created for the same words for different tokenizers that are built to identify code, text, chat, etc. Hands-On Large Language Models by Jay Alammar, Maarten Grootendorst Identify spelling mistakes and review the same.

This is because you haven't imported the `transformers` library correctly, or there's an issue with your installation. Here's how to fix it: 1. **Install the `transformers` library:** If you haven't already, install the `transformers` library using pip: ```bash pip install transformers ``` 2. **Correct Import:** Make sure you're importing `AutoTokenizer` correctly at the beginning of your script. You've included `from transformers import AutoTokenizer`, which is correct, but ensure it's at the top of your file *before* you use `AutoTokenizer`. Here's the corrected code: ```python from transformers import AutoTokenizer colors_list = ['102;194;165', '252;141;98', '141;160;203', '231;138;195', '166;216;84', '255;217;47'] def show_tokens(sentence, tokenizer_name): # Fuction that takes a sentence and tokenizer and prints the tokens try: tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(tokenizer_name) token_ids = tokenizer(sentence).input_ids for i, token in enumerate(token_ids): print(f'\\x1b[0;30;48;2;{colors_list[i % len(colors_list)]}m'+ tokenizer.decode(token)+ '\\x1b[0m', end=' ') print() #add a newline for better readability except Exception as e: print(f\"Error processing {tokenizer_name}: {e}\") text = \"\"\" Harsha is a Data Scientist currently working as a Senior Consultant at Deloitte in Hyderabad, India. </p> <p>He has <span id=\"yearsofexp\">10</span> years of data science and machine learning experience.</p> <p>He built solutions for companies such as Walmart, Pepsico, Rolls-Royce, Dr-Reddys, Tesco, and Tata AIA. </p> <p>He is proficient in Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PySpark and cloud platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud.</p> <script type=\"text/javascript\"> // Define a function called diff_years that calculates the difference in years between two given dates (dt2 and dt1) function diff_years(dt2, dt1) { // Calculate the difference in milliseconds between the two dates var diff = (dt2.getTime() - dt1.getTime()) / 1000; // Convert the difference from milliseconds to days diff /= (60 * 60 * 24); // Calculate the approximate number of years by dividing the difference in days by the average number of days in a year (365.25) return Math.abs(Math.round(diff / 365.25)); } dt1 = new Date(2017, 11, 4); // October 4 2017 dt2 = new Date(); // Today document.getElementById(\"yearsofexp\").innerHTML = diff_years(dt2, dt1) </script> <p>\"\"\" show_tokens(text, \"bert-base-uncased\") show_tokens(text, \"bert-base-cased\") show_tokens(text, \"gpt2\") show_tokens(text, \"google/flan-t5-base\") # The following two models are extremely large; uncomment only if you have sufficient resources. #show_tokens(text, \"Xenova/gpt-4\") #show_tokens(text, \"bigcode/starcoder2-15b\") show_tokens(text, \"facebook/galactica-125m\") show_tokens(text, \"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\") ``` **Important Considerations:** * **Large Models:** Some of the models you listed (like `Xenova/gpt-4` and `bigcode/starcoder2-15b`) are *extremely* large. Downloading and using them requires significant GPU memory (VRAM). If you don't have a powerful GPU, you'll likely run out of memory. It's best to start with smaller models like `bert-base-uncased` to test your code. I've commented out those lines in the example above. * **Error Handling:** I've added a `try...except` block around the tokenizer loading and processing. This will catch potential errors (like a model not being found) and prevent your entire script from crashing. It prints informative error messages. After making these changes, run your script again. If you still have problems, provide the complete error message you see, including the traceback. This will help pinpoint the exact issue.

This involves: 3.1. Grammar and Spelling Checks: Identifying and suggesting corrections for grammatical errors and misspellings within the text. 3.2. Code Analysis: Analyzing code snippets for potential errors, bugs, and inefficiencies. 3.3. Style and Tone Suggestions: Providing recommendations on writing style, tone, and overall readability. 4. Learning: After each editing session, the tool should analyse the feedback on its suggestions. # Import packages import os import config os . environ [ \"GOOGLE_API_KEY\" ] = config . gemini_api_key from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor , create_react_agent , Tool from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate import google.generativeai as genai from langchain_google_genai import ChatGoogleGenerativeAI Gemini-pro is my primary model.

Most Generative AI models split the input data into tokens and output one token at a time. Different Generative AI models can split the same sentence into different types of tokens. This is due to three major factors: 1. Tokenisation method 2. Parameters and special tokens used to initialise the tokenizer 3. Dataset the LLM is trained on Let us look at a specific text and compare how different popular models split it into tokens. The above text contains the first few lines of my website. This contains conversational text, lots of company and technology names, numbers and javascript code. Let us see how different LLM's split it as tokenisors. The Google-based Bert model was introduced in 2018 and was pre-trained in self supervised fashion (no human labels) with two objectives: 1. Masked language modelling: Model has to predict missing words between sentences 2. Next sentence prediction: Predict the next sentence The uncased model does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters. We can see that the model ignores new lines and spaces used for coding and is thus not suitable for coding. Because of the absence of new lines, it can be difficult to understanding chat logs and similar texts. Some words such as \"Walmart\" are split into two tokens wal and ##mart, '##' characters indicating that the token is a partial token. It does not identify company names such as \"Deloitte\" & \"Tesco\" and common technology names such as \"Tableau\", \"Pyspark\". It starts with a [CLS] token for classification tasks and ends with a [SEP] token for the separator token. The other tokens used in the model are [PAD] padding token, [UNK] for unknown and [MASK] for masking token (used while training). This model is similar to the BERT uncased model but it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters. Tokens such as consultant in the uncased model have been split into Consult and ##ing in the cased model. OpenAI's GPT 2 is a large language model built to predict the next word given all the previous words. It was built on 40GB of text and has 1.5 Billion parameters. It is trained using unsupervised unlabeled data. New lines are now represented in the tokenizer, along with capitalisation being preserved. Company names such as Pepsico, Rolls Royce and Deloitte are identified using multiple tokens along with common technology names such as Tableau and PySpark. The spaces used for indentation for coding are represented by one token each, and the final space is part of the next character. These whitespace characters can be useful in generating and reading code and indentation. Google's Flan T5 is an encoder-decoder based model that is language-independent and trained on a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. It was built for various tasks such as translation, question/answering, sequence classification etc. No newline or whitespace tokens would make it difficult to work with code. It is also unable to identify various characters and uses the unknown token /[UNK/] for the same. ChatGPT 4 improves on the GPT 2 model with 1.5 Billion parameters and is the most popular of all LLM models. GPT4 tokenizer represents four spaces as a single token which helps in understanding and writing code. It has different tokens for different combinations of white spaces and tabs. It generally uses fewer tokens to represent most words. Starcoder 2 is a 15 Billion parameter model focused on creating code. It identifies numbers like 2024 with four tokens, one for each number leading to a better representation of numbers and mathematics. Similar to GPT-4, it has a list of whitespaces encoded as a single token. While simple words and common nouns are represented by a number of tokens. Facebook's Galactica is an LLM that is focused on scientific knowledge and is trained on many scientific papers. Its primary usage is for citation prediction, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, summarization, document generation, molecular property prediction and entity extraction. Of all the examples here, this tokenizer has the maximum number of tokens and uses multiple tokens to identify javascript, Walmart, Hyderabad, Azure, Pyspark etc. Microsoft's phi-3 reuses the tokenizer of Lamma 2 and adds a number of special tokens. Phi-3 models are trained using both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization and are primarily built for precise instruction adherence. Some additional special tokens such as <|user|>, <|assistant|> and,|system|> are added for dealing with chat and conversations. <|endoftext|> is another token to denote the end of text. Different tokenizers show different ways in which they tokenize the words, and this is driven largely by three factors: 1. Tokenization method: The most popular is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) 2. Tokenizing parameters: Vocabulary size, Special tokens and Capitalisation 3. Domain of the data: The tokenizer behaviour is dependent on the data on which it is trained which is chosen based on the specific use case for which it is built. We can see in the above examples how tokens are created for the same words for different tokenizers that are built to identify code, text, chat, etc. Hands-On Large Language Models by Jay Alammar, Maarten Grootendorst Identify spelling mistakes and review the same.

Here's how to fix it: 1. **Install the `transformers` library:** If you haven't already, install the `transformers` library using pip: ```bash pip install transformers ``` 2. **Correct Import:** Make sure you're importing `AutoTokenizer` correctly at the beginning of your script.

Downloading and using them requires significant GPU memory (VRAM). If you don't have a powerful GPU, you'll likely run out of memory. It's best to start with smaller models like `bert-base-uncased` to test your code. I've commented out those lines in the example above. * **Error Handling:** I've added a `try...except` block around the tokenizer loading and processing. This will catch potential errors (like a model not being found) and prevent your entire script from crashing. It prints informative error messages. After making these changes, run your script again. If you still have problems, provide the complete error message you see, including the traceback. This will help pinpoint the exact issue.

In this blog, we will discuss and implement the backpropagation algorithm from scratch. In the previous blog, we have seen how a single perceptron works when the data is linearly separable. In this blog, we will look at the workings of a multi-layered perceptron (with theory) and understand the maths behind backpropagation. Multi-layer perceptron \u00b6 An MLP is composed of one input layer, one or more layers of perceptrons called hidden layers, and one final perceptron layer called the output layer. Every layer except the input layer is connected with a bias neuron and is fully connected to the next layer. Perceptron \u00b6 In the previous blog, we saw a perceptron with a single TLU. A Perceptron with two inputs and three outputs is shown below. Generally, an extra bias feature is added as input. It represents a particular type of neuron called a bias neuron. A bias neuron outputs one all the time. This layer of TLUs is called a perceptron. In the above perceptron, the inputs are x1 and x2. The outputs are y1, y2 and y3. \u0398 (or f) is the activation function. In the last blog, the step function is taken as the activation function. There are other activation functions such as: Sigmoid function : It is S-shaped, continuous and differentiable where the output ranges from 0 to 1. $$ f(z)=\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}} $$ Hyperbolic Tangent function : It is S-shaped, continuous and differentiable where the output ranges from -1 to 1. $$ f\\left(z\\right)=Tanh\\left(z\\right) $$ ReLU : Rectified Linear Unit function or ReLU is continuous but not differentiable at z=0. It can be defined as max(z,0), so it is zero for all negative values of z, and linear for all positive values. $$ f(z) = max(z,0) $$ Training \u00b6 Training a network in ANN has three stages, feedforward of input training pattern, backpropagation of the error and adjustment of weights. Let us understand it using a simple example. Consider a simple two-layered perceptron as shown: Nomenclature \u00b6 Symbol Meaning Symbol Meaning \\(X_i\\) Input neuron \\(Y_k\\) Output neuron \\(x_i\\) Input value \\(y_k\\) or \\(y_{actual}\\) Output value \\(Z_j\\) Hidden neuron \\(z_j\\) The output of a hidden neuron \\(w_{jk}\\) Weight of j to k \\(v_{ij}\\) weight of i to j \\(\\theta_k\\) Error propagating from \\(Y_k\\) to \\(Z_k\\) \\(\\theta_j\\) Error propagating from \\(Z_k\\) to \\(X_k\\) \\(\\delta_k\\) The portion of error correction for weight \\(w_{jk}\\) \\(\\delta_j\\) The portion of error correction for weight \\(v_{ij}\\) \\(\\alpha\\) Learning rate \\(t_j\\) or \\(y_{pred}\\) Predicted output f Activation function -- -- Initialising \u00b6 import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import random np . random . seed ( 42 ) num_inputs = 50 input_dimension = 2 hidden_layer_dimension = 2 output_dimension = 2 alpha = 0.1 Let us consider the sigmoid function as an activation function and create input and output values. # Sigmoid function def sigmoid ( model_output ): return 1 / ( 1 + np . exp ( - model_output )) # Creating random input values x = np . array ([[ random . random (), random . random ()] for x in range ( num_inputs )]) # Creating output values y_actual = sigmoid ( sigmoid ( x ) + random . random () * 0.1 ) + random . random () * 0.1 # The first input to the model is x [ 0 ] array([0.17988842, 0.42611707]) Adding a bias neuron bias = np . ones (( num_inputs , 1 )) x_bias = np . hstack (( bias , x )) # Adding the bias, the input becomes x_bias [ 0 ] array([1. , 0.17988842, 0.42611707]) Creating the hidden layer and initialising weights with random numbers v = np . random . randn ( input_dimension + 1 , hidden_layer_dimension ) # Inital weights are v array([[ 0.49671415, -0.1382643 ], [ 0.64768854, 1.52302986], [-0.23415337, -0.23413696]]) Creating the output layer and initialising weights with random numbers w = np . random . randn ( hidden_layer_dimension + 1 , output_dimension ) # Hidden layer weights are w array([[ 1.57921282, 0.76743473], [-0.46947439, 0.54256004], [-0.46341769, -0.46572975]]) Feedforward loop \u00b6 During feedforward, each input unit \\(X_i\\) receives input and broadcasts the signal to each of the hidden units \\(Z_1\\ldots Z_j\\) . Each hidden unit then computes its activation and sends its signal ( \\(z_j\\) ) to each output unit. Each output unit \\(Y_k\\) computes its activation ( \\(y_k\\) ) to form the response to the input pattern. Input layer \u00b6 Step 1. Each input unit ( \\(X_i\\) ) receives the input \\(x_i\\) and broadcasts this signal to all units to the hidden layers \\(Z_j\\) . Hidden layer \u00b6 Step 2. Each hidden unit ( \\(Z_j\\) ) sums its weighted input signals \\(z\\_in_j=v_{0j}+\\sum_{i} x_i\\times v_{ij}\\) Z_input = x_bias . dot ( v ) # Input to the hidden layer Z_input [ 0 ] array([0.51344907, 0.03594138]) Step 3.

Based on this error, \\(\\delta_k\\) is computed. This \\(\\delta_k\\) is used to distribute the error at the output unit back to all input units in the previous layers. Similarly, \\(\\delta_j\\) is computed for all hidden layers \\(Z_j\\) which is propagated to the input layer. Output layer \u00b6 Step 7. The error information term ( \\(\\theta_k\\) ) is computed at every output unit ( \\(Y_k\\) ). $$ \\theta_k=\\left(t_k-y_k\\right)f\u2019 $$ $$ \\delta_k=\\left(t_k-y_k\\right)f\u2019 y_in_k $$ Note: \\(f\u2019(z) = \\frac{d}{dz}(\\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}) = f(z)\\times(1-f(z))\\) theta_k = ( y_pred - y_actual ) * ( y_pred * ( 1 - y_pred )) delta_k = z_bias .

What we want to do is to find the effect of changing the weights on the error, and minimise the error using gradient descent. The error gradient that has to be minimised is given by: $$ E=\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k}\\left(t_k-y_k\\right)^2 $$ The effect of changing an outer layer weight ( \\(w_{jk}\\) ) on the error is given by: $$ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{jk}}=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{jk}}\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{k}\\left(t_k-y_k\\right)^2 $$ $$ =\\left(y_k-t_k\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial w_{jk}}f\\left(y_in_k\\right) $$ $$ =\\left(y_k-t_k\\right)\\times z_j\\times f'\\left(y_in_k\\right) $$ Therefore $$ \\Delta w_{jk}=\\alpha\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial w_{jk}}=\\alpha\\times\\left(y_k-t_k\\right)\\times z_j\\times f^\\prime\\left(y_in_k\\right)={\\alpha\\times\\delta}_k\\times z_j $$ The effect of changing the weight of a hidden layer weight ( \\(v_{ij}\\) ) on the error is given by: $$ \\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial v_{ij}}=\\sum_{k}{\\left(y_k-t_k\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_{ij}}f\\left(y_k\\right)} $$ $$ =\\sum_{k}\\left(y_k-t_k\\right)f^\\prime\\left(y_in_k\\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial v_{ij}}f\\left(y_k\\right) $$ $$ =\\sum_{k}\\delta_kf^\\prime\\left(z_in_j\\right)\\left[x_i\\right] =\\delta_j\\times x_i $$ Therefore $$ \\Delta v_{ij}=\\alpha\\frac{\\partial E}{\\partial v_{ij}}={\\alpha\\times\\delta}_j\\times x_i $$ This way, for any number of layers, we can find the error information terms.

Let us take suppliers buyers as an example. In a matching problem, our job is to match the suppliers to buyers so that both sides/ either side are satisfied. Matching problems can be considered as network problems. In network terms, matching is a subset of edges where every node in one group goes through only one node in the other group. There should be only one edge from each node. # Import networkx library and rename it as nx. import networkx as nx # Other packages required import numpy as np import pandas as pd import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Unweighted bipartite mapping \u00b6 Let us take a simple example of mapping students and dorm rooms. In this problem, students give a list of rooms they are willing to stay at. We represent students on side as nodes of a bipartite graph and rooms on the other side as nodes, and we put an edge between students and rooms as per this list. We want to map students and rooms. Furthermore, we want to identify a subset where we match one student to exactly one other room (no roommates). The students give what rooms are acceptable, and many solutions are possible. Consider the below problem where we have students (A, B, C and D) and we want to match them to rooms (1,2,3,4). The list of acceptable rooms for each student is given below. edgelist_df = pd . DataFrame ({ 'node1' :[ 'A' , 'A' , 'B' , 'B' , 'C' , 'C' , 'D' , 'D' ], 'node2' :[ 1 , 2 , 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 1 ]}) edgelist_df .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } node1 node2 0 A 1 1 A 2 2 B 2 3 B 3 4 C 3 5 C 4 6 D 4 7 D 1 This can be represented as a bipartite graph as follows g = nx .

Halls theorem \u00b6 But before Halls theorem, let us look at constricted set. Constricted set : A constricted set is a subset of edges (on either side) whose neighbours are smaller than the subset. For example, if we have two students (subset of students) who give only one room (same room) in the list, then the size of the students is 2 and the size of the rooms is one, and no matching can be done. Halls theorem states that for a mapping to exist, there should be no constricted set. Augmenting paths 1. Select any random matching of unmatched nodes. 2. Switch to the augmented paths if it exists. If it doesn't exist, then we have a constricted set, and we cannot do matching. 3. Repeat until all left nodes are matched to one right node. This is implemented in NetworkX as follows: # Select random edges selected_edges = [] for left_node in left : # For a left node, select a random node in the right list_of_nodes = list ( g . edges ( left_node )) random_node = np . random . randint ( len ( list_of_nodes )) selected_edges . append ( list_of_nodes [ random_node ]) selected_edges [('D', 4), ('C', 4), ('A', 2), ('B', 3)] Selected edges are shown in green for edge in g . edges : if edge in selected_edges or ( edge [ 1 ], edge [ 0 ]) in selected_edges : g . add_edge ( edge [ 0 ], edge [ 1 ], color = 'g' , weight = 10 ) else : g . add_edge ( edge [ 0 ], edge [ 1 ], color = 'b' , weight = 0.1 ) nx . draw ( g , pos = nx . get_node_attributes ( g , 'pos' ), with_labels = True , edge_color = nx . get_edge_attributes ( g , 'color' ) . values ()) We can see that this is not matching as node C and D are mapped to 4. This can be resolved by moving through the augmented paths for the C-4 node. For the C-4 node, moving through the augmented path selects the C-3 and D-4 node. Following the same process with B-3 and A-3 nodes, we get: selected_edges = {( 1 , 'A' ), ( 2 , 'B' ), ( 3 , 'C' ), ( 4 , 'D' )} for edge in g . edges : if edge in selected_edges or ( edge [ 1 ], edge [ 0 ]) in selected_edges : g . add_edge ( edge [ 0 ], edge [ 1 ], color = 'g' , weight = 10 ) else : g . add_edge ( edge [ 0 ], edge [ 1 ], color = 'b' , weight = 0.1 ) nx . draw ( g , pos = nx . get_node_attributes ( g , 'pos' ), with_labels = True , edge_color = nx . get_edge_attributes ( g , 'color' ) . values ()) The final mapping is shown in green nx . algorithms . bipartite . matching . hopcroft_karp_matching ( g , top_nodes = list ( set ( edgelist_df . node1 ))) {'D': 4, 'C': 3, 'B': 2, 'A': 1, 1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'C', 4: 'D'} Weighted bipartite mapping \u00b6 In the previous problem, we tried to find a perfect matching in an unweighted graph. What if every edge in the graph has certain weight attached to it. The weights could be quality index (for student-dorm matching) or valuations in a market etc. Consider the suppliers-buyers example for a housing market as shown below. We have three suppliers, A, B and C and three buyers (x, y and z). The valuation for each of the sellers is also given. For example, buyer x values house A with 12, house B with 4 and house C with 2. sellers = [ 'A' , 'B' , 'C' ] buyers = [ 'x' , 'y' , 'z' ] valuations_for_buyers = [[ 12 , 4 , 2 ], [ 8 , 7 , 6 ], [ 7 , 5 , 2 ]] sellers_price = [ 0 , 0 , 0 ] g = nx . Graph () pos = {} # Update position for node from each group for i , node in enumerate ( sellers ): g . add_node ( node , pos = ( 0 , len ( sellers ) - i )) for i , node in enumerate ( buyers ): g . add_node ( node , pos = ( 1 , len ( buyers ) - i )) # Plot text for the buyers for i , buyer in enumerate ( buyers ): plt . text ( 1.1 , len ( buyers ) - i , s = valuations_for_buyers [ i ], horizontalalignment = 'left' ) # Plot text for the sellers for i , buyer in enumerate ( buyers ): plt . text ( - 0.1 , len ( buyers ) - i , s = sellers_price [ i ], horizontalalignment = 'right' ) nx . draw ( g , pos = nx . get_node_attributes ( g , 'pos' ), with_labels = True ) What we want to achieve is clearing of the market. Clearing happens when all houses are sold to one buyer, and every buyer bought one house. This can be done using an auction algorithm. 1. Sellers quote a price 2. Buyers calculate utility: Net valuation (payoff) = Gross Valuation - Price charged by seller 3. Buyers select the object that has the highest payoff 4. If the market is not cleared, the sellers who have more than one offer (overdetermined) will increase the price by one unit, and the process is repeated. # Function to pick the supplier with the maximumm utility def match_to_maximum_utility ( sellers , buyers , valuation , price ): max_utility_sellers = {} for buyer_index in range ( len ( buyers )): max_utility = 0 for seller_index in range ( len ( sellers )): if ( max_utility < valuation [ buyer_index ][ seller_index ] - price [ seller_index ]): max_utility = valuation [ buyer_index ][ seller_index ] - price [ seller_index ] max_utility_sellers [ buyers [ buyer_index ]] = [ sellers [ seller_index ]] elif ( max_utility == valuation [ buyer_index ][ seller_index ] - price [ seller_index ]): max_utility_sellers [ buyers [ buyer_index ]] . append ( sellers [ seller_index ]) return max_utility_sellers Assuming that the initial price set by the seller is zero (scaled to zero - displayed beside the node), buyer x calculates the following utility: - For A: 12-0 = 12 - For B: 4-0 = 4 - For C: 2-0 = 2 As the utility of A is the highest, x will choose A. Similarly, B and C will also choose A. max_util = match_to_maximum_utility ( sellers , buyers , valuations_for_buyers , sellers_price ) max_util {'x': ['A'], 'y': ['A'], 'z': ['A']} Plotting the selection, we see that A is overdetermined. def plot_max_utility_graph ( sellers , buyers , valuations_for_buyers , sellers_price , max_util ): g = nx . Graph () pos = {} # Update position for node from each group for i , node in enumerate ( sellers ): g . add_node ( node , pos = ( 0 , len ( sellers ) - i )) for i , node in enumerate ( buyers ): g . add_node ( node , pos = ( 1 , len ( buyers ) - i )) # Make edges for key , values in max_util . items (): for value in values : g . add_edge ( key , value ) # Plot text for the buyers for i , buyer in enumerate ( buyers ): plt . text ( 1.1 , len ( buyers ) - i , s = valuations_for_buyers [ i ], horizontalalignment = 'left' ) # Plot text for the sellers for i , buyer in enumerate ( buyers ): plt . text ( - 0.1 , len ( buyers ) - i , s = sellers_price [ i ], horizontalalignment = 'right' ) nx . draw ( g , pos = nx . get_node_attributes ( g , 'pos' ), with_labels = True ) plt . show () plot_max_utility_graph ( sellers , buyers , valuations_for_buyers , sellers_price , max_util ) For the overdetermined edge A, we increase the price by one unit. def get_overdetermined_edge_and_increase_price ( sellers , sellers_price , max_util ): from collections import Counter counts = dict ( Counter ( sum ( max_util . values (), []))) over_determined_list = [] for key , value in counts . items (): if ( value > 1 ): over_determined_list . append ( key ) sellers_price [ sellers . index ( key )] += 1 print ( 'Nodes' , over_determined_list , 'are over determined. Added 1 to the price for the suppliers' ) return counts get_overdetermined_edge_and_increase_price ( sellers , sellers_price , max_util ) Nodes ['A'] are over determined. Added 1 to the price for the suppliers {'A': 3} We then continue this process until the market is cleared. no_of_sellers_selected = 0 while ( no_of_sellers_selected != len ( sellers )): max_util = match_to_maximum_utility ( sellers , buyers , valuations_for_buyers , sellers_price ) plot_max_utility_graph ( sellers , buyers , valuations_for_buyers , sellers_price , max_util ) counts = get_overdetermined_edge_and_increase_price ( sellers , sellers_price , max_util ) no_of_sellers_selected = len ( counts ) # need not always be the case, check Nodes ['A'] are over determined. Added 1 to the price for the suppliers Nodes ['A', 'B'] are over determined. Added 1 to the price for the suppliers Nodes ['A', 'B'] are over determined. Added 1 to the price for the suppliers We can see that for costs (A:3, B:1, C:0), the market can be cleared with buyer x choosing A, y choosing C and z choosing B. This is the maximum weight perfect matching. Matching with preferences \u00b6 In the previous scenario, we had weights on the edges which indicated the utility. In this case we will look at matching where we have preferences in a ranked order. This is more natural way in many scenarios, like students' preference to universities/universities selecting students, dating scenarios etc. This was originally implemented by Al Roth for matching hospitals and residency. Our goal is to clear the market, but also have a stable matching. So, what is a stable matching? Stable matching : Stability is an equilibrium when no pair on ether side has an incentive to deviate from the mapping. Let us understand this using an example. Take the dating scenario for example. On the left-hand side we have men and on the right-hand side we have women. All men rank women in strict order and all women rank men in strict order. In a stable matching, no pair of nodes (male-female) prefers each other to their currently assigned partners. Gale Shapley Algorithm \u00b6 Let us say that are n players on both sides with males(m) on one side and women(w) on another side. The algorithm is as follows: 1. Every unmatched male (m) proposes to their first preference available. 2. If the proposed women (w) is unmatched, w accepts. If the women is already matched and the m has higher preference for w, w switches. Else, previous mapping remains. 3. This process continues until there is stability Let's take an example with three males and three females. The preferences are mentioned at the side of the node in a list. For example, m2 has a preference w2, followed by w3 and then w1. Similarly, w2 has a preference of m3, followed by m1 and then m2. males = [ 'm1' , 'm2' , 'm3' ] females = [ 'w1' , 'w2' , 'w3' ] male_preferences = [[ 'w1' , 'w2' , 'w3' ], [ 'w2' , 'w3' , 'w1' ], [ 'w2' , 'w3' , 'w1' ]] female_preferences = [[ 'm2' , 'm3' , 'm1' ], [ 'm3' , 'm1' , 'm2' ], [ 'm1' , 'm2' , 'm3' ]] def match_next_male ( male_index , males , females , male_preferences , female_preferences ): for female in male_preferences [ male_index ]: if ( female not in current_mapping . values ()): current_mapping [ males [ male_index ]] = female return current_mapping elif ( female in current_mapping . values ()): current_mapping_inverse = dict ( zip ( current_mapping . values (), current_mapping . keys ())) current_male_for_the_female = current_mapping_inverse [ female ] if ( female_preferences [ males . index ( current_male_for_the_female )] > female_preferences [ male_index ]): current_mapping [ males [ male_index ]] = female current_mapping . pop ( current_male_for_the_female ) return current_mapping def plot_max_utility_graph ( males , females , male_preferences , female_preferences , current_mapping ): g = nx . Graph () pos = {} # Update position for node from each group for i , node in enumerate ( males ): g . add_node ( node , pos = ( 0 , len ( males ) - i )) for i , node in enumerate ( females ): g . add_node ( node , pos = ( 1 , len ( females ) - i )) # Make edges for key , value in current_mapping . items (): g . add_edge ( key , value ) # Plot text for the males for i , male in enumerate ( males ): plt . text ( - 0.1 , len ( males ) - i , s = male_preferences [ i ], horizontalalignment = 'right' ) # Plot text for the females for i , female in enumerate ( females ): plt . text ( 1.1 , len ( females ) - i , s = female_preferences [ i ], horizontalalignment = 'left' ) nx . draw ( g , pos = nx . get_node_attributes ( g , 'pos' ), with_labels = True ) plt . show () print ( '_____________________________________________________________________________' ) current_mapping = {} while ( len ( current_mapping ) != len ( males )): for male_index in range ( len ( males )): if ( current_mapping . get ( males [ male_index ]) is None ): current_mapping = match_next_male ( male_index , males , females , male_preferences , female_preferences ) plot_max_utility_graph ( males , females , male_preferences , female_preferences , current_mapping ) _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________ The process goes on as follows: 1. m1 proposes to w1 as w1 has maximum rank and as w1 is unselected, w1 accepts. We create an edge between them. 2. m2 proposes to w2 as w2 has maximum rank, and as w2 is unselected, w2 accepts. We create an edge between them. 3. m3 also proposes to w2. As w2 is already selected, it checks the preference of the current selection (m2) to m3. As m3 has better preference, w2 switches from m2 to m3. The edge between m2 and w2 is removed and a new edge between m3 and w2 is created. 4. m2 is currently unmapped, and selects the next best preference, which is w3. As w3 is unselected, w3 accepts. 5. This clears the market and the process stops. This is stable mapping (from the men's side). These are the common matching techniques that exist.

In this case we will look at matching where we have preferences in a ranked order. This is more natural way in many scenarios, like students' preference to universities/universities selecting students, dating scenarios etc. This was originally implemented by Al Roth for matching hospitals and residency. Our goal is to clear the market, but also have a stable matching. So, what is a stable matching? Stable matching : Stability is an equilibrium when no pair on ether side has an incentive to deviate from the mapping. Let us understand this using an example. Take the dating scenario for example. On the left-hand side we have men and on the right-hand side we have women. All men rank women in strict order and all women rank men in strict order. In a stable matching, no pair of nodes (male-female) prefers each other to their currently assigned partners.","title":"Matching with preferences"},{"location":"Python/Bipartite%20matching/#gale-shapley-algorithm","text":"Let us say that are n players on both sides with males(m) on one side and women(w) on another side.

If the women is already matched and the m has higher preference for w, w switches. Else, previous mapping remains. 3. This process continues until there is stability Let's take an example with three males and three females. The preferences are mentioned at the side of the node in a list.

As w2 is already selected, it checks the preference of the current selection (m2) to m3. As m3 has better preference, w2 switches from m2 to m3. The edge between m2 and w2 is removed and a new edge between m3 and w2 is created. 4. m2 is currently unmapped, and selects the next best preference, which is w3. As w3 is unselected, w3 accepts. 5.

It is a top-down approach where we take the whole network and try to break it into two communities. This can be continued till the bottom. Steps: 1. Define betweenness measure for each edge 2.

Minimum cut will have the least ratio cut among all the other cuts. $$ Ratio\\,Cut\\, (P_{Red}) = \\frac{1}{number\\, of\\, partitions}\\times (\\frac{no\\, of\\, edges\\, in\\, partition1}{no\\, of\\, nodes\\, in\\, partition1} + \\frac{no\\, of\\, edges\\, in\\, partition2}{no\\, of\\, nodes\\, in\\, partition2} + ..) $$ This can be done quickly using an inbuilt function in NetworkX from networkx.algorithms import community communities = community . kernighan_lin_bisection ( G , max_iter = 100 ) pos = nx . spring_layout ( G ) nx . draw ( G , pos , with_labels = True , node_size = 100 , node_color = 'w' , node_shape = '.' ) for i in range ( len ( communities )): nx . draw_networkx_nodes ( G , pos , nodelist = communities [ i ], node_color = colors [ i ]) Other methods \u00b6 There are many other methods that can be used to identify communities, one of which is based on modularity.

Data \u00b6 Organizations face a significant challenge in motivating their employees. This is the continuation of a blog series in which we used several feature engineering strategies to create a comprehensive dataset and then predicted who would be absent using machine learning and Scikit-Learn . In this blog, we will use this information to predict employee absenteeism. The purpose is to identify those who are likely to be absent in the near future. As a first step, load and examine the data. import pandas as pd % matplotlib inline import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import random import numpy as np np . random . seed ( 42 ) df = pd . read_csv ( '/content/gdrive/MyDrive/data_after_feature_engg.csv' ) df Unnamed: 0 employee date last_likes last_dislikes feedbackType likes_till_date dislikes_till_date last_2_likes last_2_dislikes ... employee_joined_after_jun17 countdown_to_last_day reason on_leave no_leaves_till_date last_2_days_leaves previous_day_leave weekday month week 0 23729 17r 2018-05-29 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Tuesday May 1 1 23730 17r 2018-05-30 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Wednesday May 2 2 23731 17r 2018-05-31 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Thursday May 3 3 23732 17r 2018-06-01 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Friday Jun 1 4 23733 17r 2018-06-02 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Saturday Jun 2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 33446 32232 zGB 2019-03-07 24.0 8.0 OTHER 24.0 8.0 24.0 8.0 ... 0.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Thursday Mar 0 33447 32233 zGB 2019-03-08 24.0 8.0 OTHER 24.0 8.0 24.0 8.0 ... 0.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Friday Mar 1 33448 32234 zGB 2019-03-09 24.0 8.0 OTHER 24.0 8.0 24.0 8.0 ... 0.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Saturday Mar 2 33449 32235 zGB 2019-03-10 24.0 8.0 OTHER 24.0 8.0 24.0 8.0 ... 0.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Sunday Mar 3 33450 32236 zGB 2019-03-11 24.0 8.0 OTHER 24.0 8.0 24.0 8.0 ... 0.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Monday Mar 4 33451 rows \u00d7 31 columns In the previous blog, we created the key features required for this binary classification task.

This promotes faster convergence, reduces the vanishing gradient problem, and increases stability. We will look into these concerns later. from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler sc = StandardScaler () x_train = sc . fit_transform ( x_train ) x_test = sc . transform ( x_test ) input_length = len ( x_train [ 0 ]) Sequential API \u00b6 Keras provides two basic approaches: a sequential model API and a functional model API. The sequential model API works well for the majority of basic neural networks. Let us build a simple neural network with one input layer, three hidden layers, and one output layer. The hidden layers use the ReLU activation function, whereas the output layer uses the sigmoid activation function. import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras from keras.models import Sequential from keras.layers import Dense , Dropout , InputLayer model = Sequential ([ InputLayer ( input_shape = [ input_length ], name = 'Input_layer' ), Dense ( 40 , activation = \"relu\" , name = 'Hidden_layer_1' ), Dropout ( rate = 0.1 , name = 'Dropout_layer_1' ), Dense ( 40 , activation = \"relu\" , name = 'Hidden_layer_2' ), Dropout ( rate = 0.1 , name = 'Dropout_layer_2' ), Dense ( 40 , activation = \"relu\" , name = 'Hidden_layer_3' ), Dropout ( rate = 0.1 , name = 'Dropout_layer_3' ), Dense ( 1 , activation = \"sigmoid\" , name = 'Output_layer' ) ]) The hidden layers each have 40 neurons while the output layer has 1 neuron. The output layer represents the likelihood of being absent. Number of parameters \u00b6 In this simple network, the number of parameters in each layer is the same as the number of connections. In any layer, $$ Number\\,of\\,connections = (input_length+1)\\times(output_length) $$ \\(Number\\,of\\,input\\,neurons = input\\_neurons+bias\\_neuron = input\\_length+1\\) 1. Hidden_layer_1: (43+1)x(40) = 1760 2. Hidden_layer_2: (40+1)x(40) = 1640 3. Hidden_layer_3: (40+1)x(40) = 1640 4.

Dropout \u00b6 Dropout is the most popular form of regularization technique in which certain nodes are ignored at random during training. Adding dropout layer improves accuracy by 1-2% on average. In a dropout layer, at any training step, every neuron in the previous layer has a probability (equal to the rate) of dropping out. This dropped-out node may be active in the following step/epoch. Dropouts are said to improve the resilience of the network. accuracy_metrics = [ \"accuracy\" , \"Recall\" , \"Precision\" , keras . metrics . FalseNegatives ( name = \"fn\" ), keras . metrics .

But still, can we improve on this accuracy? Let's look at some ways we can improve any neural network model. Vanishing gradients/exploding gradients problem \u00b6 The backpropagation algorithm works by propagating the error gradient from the outer layer to the lower layers. Sometimes the gradients in the lower layers get smaller and smaller or larger and larger when flowing in DNN during training. This makes the lower layers hard to train. In the logistic activation function, for example, if the inputs become extremely large or extremely small, the function saturates at 1 or 0 with a derivative close to 0. This means there will be no gradient to propagate back to the lower layers. To reduce unstable gradients, the variance of the outputs of each layer should be equal to the variance of its inputs (the gradients should also have equal variance) after the forward and backward passes. Fine-tuning can not only help us find the best parameters but can also help us prevent vanishing or exploding gradients. Fine-tuning neural network hyperparameters \u00b6 There are multiple hyperparameters in a neural network that can be tweaked, like network architecture, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, type of activation function, and more. Many libraries can be used to handle these, like hyperopt , hyperas , keras tuner , scikit optimise , spearmint , hyperband , etc. The first step is to create a function that can build and compile a Keras model. def build_model ( n_hidden = 1 , n_neurons = 30 , learning_rate = 0.001 , hidden_layer_activation = 'relu' , kernel_initializer = 'he_normal' , input_shape = [ input_length ], kernel_regularizer = None , kernel_constraint = None , dropout_rate = 0.1 , optimizer = 'sgd' ): model = Sequential () model . add ( InputLayer ( input_shape = input_shape )) model . add ( keras . layers . BatchNormalization ()) for layer in range ( n_hidden ): model . add ( keras . layers . Dense ( n_neurons , activation = hidden_layer_activation , kernel_initializer = kernel_initializer , kernel_regularizer = kernel_regularizer , kernel_constraint = kernel_constraint )) model . add ( Dropout ( rate = dropout_rate )) model . add ( keras . layers . Dense ( 1 , activation = 'sigmoid' )) model . compile ( loss = \"binary_crossentropy\" , metrics = accuracy_metrics , optimizer = optimizer ) model . optimizer . learning_rate . assign ( learning_rate ) return model This function demonstrates some of the popular hyperparameters that can be used. Let's look at each one of them: Number of hidden layers \u00b6 Theoretically, one hidden layer will be able to model any complex function, but it will require many neurons in that layer and will require exponentially more training parameters when compared to deep networks with a smaller number of neurons in each layer. Hierarchical structures help DNNs converge faster and generalize better on new and unseen datasets. The neurons that are in layers closer to the input layer (low-level layers) model low-level structures and higher-level layers build on these low-level structures to build higher-level structures. Number of neurons per hidden layer \u00b6 There are two approaches to the number of neurons in a hidden layer. One is to stack them like a pyramid, with more neurons at hidden layers close to the input layers and decreasing them up to the output layer. The other is to have the same number of neurons in all layers. I prefer the second method because it is easier to have a larger number of neurons than needed and then to use early stopping and other regularization techniques to prevent overfitting. Batch size \u00b6 The batch size should be dependent on the type of GPUs and TPUs that are used. For regular datasets, a batch size of 32 is most optimal. Larger batch sizes have faster training but do not converge faster, while smaller batch sizes converge in a smaller number of epochs, but each epoch takes longer to train. Activation function \u00b6 For output neurons, the activation functions are as follows: Problem Type Output layer activation functions Binary classification Logistic Multiclass classification Softmax Regression None,ReLU/softplus(+vs outputs), logistic/tanh(bounded outputs) For regular DNNs, the activation function for hidden neurons is generally ReLU. ReLU's face issues known as dying RELU , where they output only 0. There are several varieties of ReLU to solve this problem. Leaky Relu \u00b6 In Leaky ReLU, a hyperparameter \\(\\alpha\\) defines the slope of the function for negative values of z. This is called a leak, which prevents ReLUs from dying. $$ LeakyReLU(z) = max(\\alpha z, z)$$ SELU \u00b6 The scaled Exponential Linear Unit is the best variant of ReLU, where an exponential function is used for negative input values in such a way that the slope at 0 is non-zero. \\[ ELU_{\\alpha}(z) =\\begin{cases} \\alpha(exp(z)-1) & z < 0 \\\\ z & z \\geq 0 \\end{cases} \\] IIf a deep neural network consists of only SELUs as the activation function in all of the hidden layers, the data will self-normalize. The output of every layer will have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This will reduce the vanishing gradients problem. Optimizer \u00b6 The optimizer used also changes the speed of training. Apart from gradient descent, another popular optimizer is the Adam optimizer. Batch normalisation \u00b6 The normalization layer normalizes the input data in such a way that the mean of the input is zero and the standard deviation is one. This can prevent the vanishing gradient issue as it forces the input and output variances to be constant at one. Weight initialisation \u00b6 Garot and He initialization can be used to initialize the weights in the network in such a way that the vanishing and exploding gradients can be reduced. Initialization Activation functions Glorot None, Tanh, Logistic, Softmax He ReLU and variants LeCun SELU Gradient clipping \u00b6 One way to reduce the vanishing gradient problem is to clip the gradients so that they never exceed a threshold during backpropagation. Regularization (l1 and l2) \u00b6 L1 regularizations can be applied to the gradients to constrain the weights of the network. L2 regularization can force many weights to be zero, making a sparse network. These can help in regularizing the weights of the network. One of the ways to find the optimized parameters is to use Grid Search CV for a smaller number of epochs and then train the best model until stopping criteria is met. from scikeras.wrappers import KerasClassifier keras_reg = KerasClassifier ( model = build_model , epochs = 25 , batch_size = 32 , verbose = 2 ) from sklearn.model_selection import RandomizedSearchCV , GridSearchCV param_distribs = { \"model__n_hidden\" : [ 3 ], \"model__n_neurons\" : [ 30 ], \"model__learning_rate\" : [ 0.01 , 0.001 ], \"model__hidden_layer_activation\" : [ 'relu' , \"elu\" ], \"model__kernel_initializer\" :[ \"he_normal\" , \"lecun_normal\" , keras . initializers .

Learning rate scheduling \u00b6 A very high learning rate might diverge and never reach optimum while a small learning rate will take a long time to arrive at A very high learning rate might diverge and never reach optimum, while a small learning rate will take a long time to reach optimum. Instead, we can train the model with a large learning rate at first and then gradually cross epochs. Reduce Learning Rate on Plateau is a method where the learning rate is reduced by a factor once the loss function stagnates. Early stopping and model checkpoints \u00b6 Model checkpoints and early stopping can be used when training a large number of epochs. Early stopping is a stopping criterion to stop training when the loss metric stagnates. Additionally, model checkpoints can also help in resuming training from the last saved point in case of interruptions or failures during the training process. This ensures that the training progress is not lost and can be continued seamlessly. lr_scheduler = keras . callbacks .

Sometimes the gradients in the lower layers get smaller and smaller or larger and larger when flowing in DNN during training. This makes the lower layers hard to train. In the logistic activation function, for example, if the inputs become extremely large or extremely small, the function saturates at 1 or 0 with a derivative close to 0. This means there will be no gradient to propagate back to the lower layers. To reduce unstable gradients, the variance of the outputs of each layer should be equal to the variance of its inputs (the gradients should also have equal variance) after the forward and backward passes. Fine-tuning can not only help us find the best parameters but can also help us prevent vanishing or exploding gradients.","title":"Vanishing gradients/exploding gradients problem"},{"location":"Python/DNN/#fine-tuning-neural-network-hyperparameters","text":"There are multiple hyperparameters in a neural network that can be tweaked, like network architecture, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, type of activation function, and more.

This assumes that the dataset in which the model is trained is a proper representative sample of the population. This model is assumed as a static object. In order to learn from new data, the model has to be re-trained from scratch. This is the most common form of deploying models. Online learning : Some machine learning models that we know can be modified to learn on a single data point (row). When we can learn from a single data point, we can learn incrementally from new data points. Data is considered as a stream. Once the model is trained, we need not store the historic training set. The model is also more up to date. If the data's distribution happens over time, the model will be able to handle it (drift)[1]. Where can we use them? They are most useful in scenarios where new data and patterns are constantly arriving. Example: 1. Spam filtering 2. Recommendation engines (news feed predictions) 3. Financial transactions 4. Low compute power (only one data point exists in memory as we train using one data point only) Issues 1. New and not a lot of experience 2. Very few tools and packages 3. All algorithms do not have an online version. Kernel SVM's are impossible to fit on a streaming dataset. Likewise, CART and ID3 decision trees can\u2019t be trained online. However, lesser-known online approximations exist, such as random Fourier features for SVM's and Hoeffding trees for decision trees. 4. Slower than batch learning to reach steady state in real life (It is computationally faster by more than an order of magnitude) 5. Do not guarantee that models learnt are similar to the ones obtained in batch mode(some models). Some models do not guarantee of achieving steady state. 6. Overfitting Similarities We have the same limitations of machine learning, such as: 1. We need to do proper preprocessing 2. We need to do feature engineering as usual 3. The concepts of ensembles, feature extraction, feature selection, imbalanced classes, multiclass etc are same Preprocessing steps \u00b6 How do we preprocess data when we are streaming? How do we impute the null values by mean if we do not have complete data? How do we identify outliers when working on one row at a time? How can we do one-hot encoding when we don't know what classes are present overall? The package river is a handy package for online learning. It has a lot of pre-defined preprocessing functions. Let us look at some of them: from river import preprocessing dir ( preprocessing )[ 0 : 12 ] ['AdaptiveStandardScaler', 'Binarizer', 'FeatureHasher', 'LDA', 'MaxAbsScaler', 'MinMaxScaler', 'Normalizer', 'OneHotEncoder', 'PreviousImputer', 'RobustScaler', 'StandardScaler', 'StatImputer'] There are six functions for scaling and normalizing data. They are: 1. AdaptiveStandardScalar 2. MaxAbsScalar 3. MinMaxScalar 4. Normalizer 5. RobustScalar 6. StandardScaler For example, let us look at the documentation for Standard Scaler It scales the data to have zero mean and unit variance. Under the hood, a running mean and a running variance are maintained. The scaling is slightly different from when scaling the data in batch because the exact means and variances are not known in advance. However, this doesn't have a detrimental impact on performance in the long run. Let us look at an example: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import random random . seed ( 1995 ) from sklearn.datasets import load_iris iris = load_iris () data1 = pd . DataFrame ( data = np . c_ [ iris [ 'data' ], iris [ 'target' ]], columns = iris [ 'feature_names' ] + [ 'target' ]) data1 = data1 . query ( 'target < 2' ) . sample ( frac = 1 ) def data_feed ( df_datafeed ): # Generator function to give the next candidate for _ctr in range ( len ( df_datafeed )): yield df_datafeed . iloc [ _ctr ] from river import compose from river import linear_model from river import preprocessing preprocessing_model = compose .

Pseudo-online models use a small batch of data to build the models, while completely online models build the models using only one data point.[3] Pseudo online models \u00b6 There are many theorems in statistics which can help us to bound the error of a metric between two variables. Hoeffding bound is one such theorem. \"Consider a real-valued random variable r whose range is R (e.g., for a probability the range is one, and for an information gain the range is log c, where c is the number of classes). Suppose we have made n independent observations of this variable, and computed their mean \\(\\bar r\\) . The Hoeffding bound states that, with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4, the true mean of the variable is at least \\(\\bar r \u2212 \\epsilon\\) , where \\(\\epsilon = \\sqrt{\\frac{R^2ln(\\frac{1}{\\lambda})}{2n}}\\) .\" This is useful while creating decision trees. Using hoeffding bound, we can identify which feature should we use to split the tree. We can find if a variable has sufficient gini index (or other metrics) greater (lesser) than other variables with a probability below a cut-off probability and split the tree based on that metric. This can be achieved with very few data points which can be deleted after splitting and creating child nodes. This algorithm is called Hoeffding trees algorithm. Completely online models \u00b6 How can we update a model using only one data point? Let us look at Gradient Descent to understand this. In gradient descent, we want to minimise a convex loss function(MSE, regret, etc). As an example, consider the function \\(h(x) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + ..\\) (or any convex function). The mean squared error is \\(J(\\theta) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_{(i)}-h_{\\theta}(x_{(i)}))^{2}\\) . In gradient descent, we find the \\(\\beta_i\\) that minimises \\(J(\\theta)\\) . In batch model, we consider all the data points that exist to identify the optimal solution. In streaming learning, we initialise the \\(\\beta_i\\) as 0 and keep incrementally changing the \\(\\beta_i\\) 's using $$ \\beta_{i, t} = \\beta_{i, t-1} + \\alpha \\times \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta_{j}} J(\\theta) $$ Steps in updating the model \u00b6 In online learning, there are 4 steps[3]. For every new data point, we will recursively run the following steps. For \\({\\displaystyle t=1,2,...,T}\\) Learner receives input \\({\\displaystyle x_{t}}\\) Learner outputs \\({\\displaystyle w_{t}}\\) from a fixed convex set \\({\\displaystyle S}\\) Nature sends back a convex loss function \\({\\displaystyle v_{t}:S\\rightarrow \\mathbb {R} }\\) . Learner suffers loss \\({\\displaystyle v_{t}(w_{t})}\\) and updates its model. Implementation using river \u00b6 Every online machine learning model has the following basic 5 functions: dir ( linear_model . LogisticRegression )[ 50 : 55 ] ['learn_many', 'learn_one', 'predict_many', 'predict_one', 'predict_proba_many'] As the name mentions, learn_one and predict_one learn and predict from one data point, learn_many, predict_many and predict_prob_many learn and predict using multiple data points. River is the result of a merger between creme and scikit-multiflow , and the remaining functions in the library follow a similar pattern to the same. Building a model \u00b6 Using the same data as above, let us build a sample model using river for streaming. from river import compose river_model = compose . Pipeline ( preprocessing .

This assumes that the dataset in which the model is trained is a proper representative sample of the population. This model is assumed as a static object. In order to learn from new data, the model has to be re-trained from scratch. This is the most common form of deploying models. Online learning : Some machine learning models that we know can be modified to learn on a single data point (row). When we can learn from a single data point, we can learn incrementally from new data points. Data is considered as a stream. Once the model is trained, we need not store the historic training set. The model is also more up to date. If the data's distribution happens over time, the model will be able to handle it (drift)[1]. Where can we use them? They are most useful in scenarios where new data and patterns are constantly arriving. Example: 1. Spam filtering 2. Recommendation engines (news feed predictions) 3. Financial transactions 4. Low compute power (only one data point exists in memory as we train using one data point only) Issues 1. New and not a lot of experience 2. Very few tools and packages 3. All algorithms do not have an online version. Kernel SVM's are impossible to fit on a streaming dataset. Likewise, CART and ID3 decision trees can\u2019t be trained online. However, lesser-known online approximations exist, such as random Fourier features for SVM's and Hoeffding trees for decision trees. 4. Slower than batch learning to reach steady state in real life (It is computationally faster by more than an order of magnitude) 5. Do not guarantee that models learnt are similar to the ones obtained in batch mode(some models). Some models do not guarantee of achieving steady state. 6. Overfitting Similarities We have the same limitations of machine learning, such as: 1. We need to do proper preprocessing 2. We need to do feature engineering as usual 3. The concepts of ensembles, feature extraction, feature selection, imbalanced classes, multiclass etc are same","title":"Streaming machine learning"},{"location":"Python/Demonstrating%20online%20learning/#preprocessing-steps","text":"How do we preprocess data when we are streaming? How do we impute the null values by mean if we do not have complete data? How do we identify outliers when working on one row at a time? How can we do one-hot encoding when we don't know what classes are present overall? The package river is a handy package for online learning. It has a lot of pre-defined preprocessing functions. Let us look at some of them: from river import preprocessing dir ( preprocessing )[ 0 : 12 ] ['AdaptiveStandardScaler', 'Binarizer', 'FeatureHasher', 'LDA', 'MaxAbsScaler', 'MinMaxScaler', 'Normalizer', 'OneHotEncoder', 'PreviousImputer', 'RobustScaler', 'StandardScaler', 'StatImputer'] There are six functions for scaling and normalizing data. They are: 1. AdaptiveStandardScalar 2. MaxAbsScalar 3. MinMaxScalar 4. Normalizer 5. RobustScalar 6. StandardScaler For example, let us look at the documentation for Standard Scaler It scales the data to have zero mean and unit variance. Under the hood, a running mean and a running variance are maintained. The scaling is slightly different from when scaling the data in batch because the exact means and variances are not known in advance. However, this doesn't have a detrimental impact on performance in the long run.

Graph () for i , elrow in edgelist_df . iterrows (): g . add_edge ( elrow [ 0 ], elrow [ 1 ], weight = elrow [ 2 ]) g . add_node ( 1 , pos = ( 0 , 5 )) g . edges ( data = True ) EdgeDataView([(1, 2, {'weight': 5}), (1, 3, {'weight': 2}), (1, 4, {'weight': 1}), (2, 4, {'weight': 3}), (2, 5, {'weight': 1}), (3, 5, {'weight': 7}), (3, 4, {'weight': 1}), (4, 5, {'weight': 4})]) # for each node we are trying to fix the coordinates g . add_node ( 1 , pos = ( 0 , 5 )) g . add_node ( 2 , pos = ( 5 , 10 )) g . add_node ( 3 , pos = ( 5 , 0 )) g . add_node ( 4 , pos = ( 10 , 5 )) g . add_node ( 5 , pos = ( 15 , 5 )) g . nodes ( data = True ) NodeDataView({1: {'pos': (0, 5)}, 2: {'pos': (5, 10)}, 3: {'pos': (5, 0)}, 4: {'pos': (10, 5)}, 5: {'pos': (15, 5)}}) This graph can be visualised as follows: # This function gets the coordinates for nodes pos = nx . get_node_attributes ( g , 'pos' ) # This function gets the weights for the edges weight = nx . get_edge_attributes ( g , 'weight' ) # The simplest way to draw a graph is by using nx.draw. nx . draw ( g , pos , with_labels = True ) # This adds edge lables nx . draw_networkx_edge_labels ( g , pos , edge_labels = weight ) plt . show () Mathematically this graph can be described in many ways. The most important are the adjacency matrix and incidence matrix. The adjacency matrix shows the relationship between the nodes in a matrix format where the nodes represent rows and columns. An edge between two nodes is represented by a positive number in the adjacency matrix, and the magnitude represents the weight. nx . linalg . graphmatrix . adj_matrix ( g ) . toarray () array([[0, 5, 2, 1, 0], [5, 0, 0, 3, 1], [2, 0, 0, 1, 7], [1, 3, 1, 0, 4], [0, 1, 7, 4, 0]], dtype=int64) The concurrency matrix represents the relationship between the nodes and edges. We have 8 edges as shown, and the relationship between the 5 nodes and 8 edges is shown below. g . edges EdgeView([(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (3, 4), (4, 5)]) nx . linalg . graphmatrix . incidence_matrix ( g ) . toarray () array([[1., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.], [1., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 0.], [0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0.], [0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 0., 1., 1.], [0., 0., 0., 0., 1., 1., 0., 1.]]) Directed graph. \u00b6 A directed graph has edges which are in a particular direction. In this example, we are creating a DiGraph and reading a file where the edgelist is defined. An edge from a to b with a weight W exists when a line \"a b W\" can be found in the file. G1 = nx . DiGraph () # Read an directed graph from a list of edges, need to specify that using the parameter \u2018create_using\u2019 G1 = nx . read_edgelist ( \"edgelist1.txt\" , nodetype = str , create_using = nx . DiGraph (), data = [( 'weight' , int )]) print ( 'Edgelist' ) import sys nx . write_weighted_edgelist ( G1 , sys . stdout ) print ( 'nodes' ) print ( G1 . nodes ( data = True )) print ( 'edges' ) print ( G1 . edges ( data = True )) Edgelist 0 1 4 0 3 4 0 4 2 1 0 4 1 2 9 1 4 1 2 3 4 3 1 8 3 4 7 nodes [('0', {}), ('1', {}), ('2', {}), ('3', {}), ('4', {})] edges [('0', '1', {'weight': 4}), ('0', '3', {'weight': 4}), ('0', '4', {'weight': 2}), ('1', '0', {'weight': 4}), ('1', '2', {'weight': 9}), ('1', '4', {'weight': 1}), ('2', '3', {'weight': 4}), ('3', '1', {'weight': 8}), ('3', '4', {'weight': 7})] This graph can be visualised in many ways. Some visualisation patterns are (And these visualisations are same for directed or undirected graphs) 1. Spring layout (The length of edges is proportional to the weights) 2. Circular layout (The nodes are present in a circle) 3.

Masked language modelling: Model has to predict missing words between sentences 2. Next sentence prediction: Predict the next sentence The uncased model does not differentiate between uppercase and lowercase letters. show_tokens ( text , \"bert-base-uncased\" ) We can see that the model ignores new lines and spaces used for coding and is thus not suitable for coding. Because of the absence of new lines, it can be difficult to understand chat logs and similar texts. Some words such as \"Walmart\" are split into two tokens wal and ##mart , '##' characters indicating that the token is a partial token. It does not identify company names such as \"Deloitte\" & \"Tesco\" and common technology names such as \"Tableau\" and \"PySpark\". It starts with a [CLS] token for classification tasks and ends with a [SEP] token for the separator token. The other tokens used in the model are [PAD] padding token, [UNK] for unknown and [MASK] for masking token (used while training). BERT base model (cased) \u00b6 This model is similar to the BERT uncased model but it differentiates between uppercase and lowercase letters. show_tokens ( text , \"bert-base-cased\" ) Tokens such as consultant in the uncased model have been split into Consult and ##ing in the cased model. GPT 2 \u00b6 OpenAI's GPT 2 is a large language model built to predict the next word given all the previous words. It was built on 40GB of text and has 1.5 billion parameters. It is trained using unsupervised unlabeled data. show_tokens ( text , \"gpt2\" ) New lines are now represented in the tokenizer, along with capitalisation being preserved. Company names such as Pepsico, Rolls Royce and Deloitte are identified using multiple tokens along with common technology names such as Tableau and PySpark. The spaces used for indentation for coding are represented by one token each, and the final space is part of the next character. These whitespace characters can be useful in generating and reading code and indentation. Flan-T5 \u00b6 Google's Flan T5 is an encoder-decoder based model that is language-independent and trained on a combination of supervised and unsupervised training. It was built for various tasks such as translation, question/answering, sequence classification etc. show_tokens ( text , \"google/flan-t5-base\" ) No newline or whitespace tokens would make it difficult to work with code. It is also unable to identify various characters and uses the unknown token /[UNK/] for the same. GPT 4 \u00b6 ChatGPT 4 improves on the GPT 2 model with 1.5 billion parameters and is the most popular of all LLM models. show_tokens ( text , \"Xenova/gpt-4\" ) The GPT-4 tokenizer represents four spaces as a single token, which helps in understanding and writing code. It has different tokens for different combinations of white spaces and tabs. It generally uses fewer tokens to represent most words. Starcoder 2 \u00b6 Starcoder 2 is a 15 billion parameter model focused on creating code. show_tokens ( text , \"bigcode/starcoder2-15b\" ) It identifies numbers like 2024 with four tokens, one for each number leading to a better representation of numbers and mathematics. Similar to GPT-4, it has a list of whitespaces encoded as a single token. While simple words and common nouns are represented by a number of tokens. Galactica \u00b6 Facebook's Galactica is an LLM that is focused on scientific knowledge and is trained on many scientific papers. Its primary usage is for citation prediction, scientific QA, mathematical reasoning, summarization, document generation, molecular property prediction and entity extraction. show_tokens ( text , \"facebook/galactica-125m\" ) Of all the examples here, this tokenizer has the maximum number of tokens and uses multiple tokens to identify JavaScript , Walmart , Hyderabad , Azure , PySpark etc. Phi-3 (and Llama-2) \u00b6 Microsoft's Phi-3 reuses the tokenizer of LLaMA-2 and adds a number of special tokens. Phi-3 models are trained using both supervised fine-tuning, proximal policy optimization, and direct preference optimization and are primarily built for precise instruction adherence. Some additional special tokens such as <|user|>, <|assistant|> and,|system|> are added for dealing with chat and conversations. <|endoftext|> is another token to denote the end of text. show_tokens ( text , \"microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct\" ) Different tokenizers show different ways in which they tokenize the words, and this is driven largely by three factors: 1. Tokenization method: The most popular is Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) 2. Tokenizing parameters: Vocabulary size, special tokens and capitalization 3. Domain of the data: The tokenizer behavior is dependent on the data on which it is trained, which is chosen based on the specific use case for which it is built.

As a first step, let us load and look at the data. import warnings warnings . filterwarnings ( 'ignore' , category = FutureWarning ) import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd import numpy as np % matplotlib inline pd . set_option ( 'display.max_columns' , None ) df = pd . read_csv ( \"data_after_feature_engg.csv\" ) df [ 'date' ] = pd . to_datetime ( df . date ) df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } Unnamed: 0 employee date last_likes last_dislikes feedbackType likes_till_date dislikes_till_date last_2_likes last_2_dislikes days_since_last_comment last_vote timezone stillExists no_of_days_since_first_vote no_of_votes_till_date perc_days_voted avg_vote_till_date avg_vote last_2_votes_avg prev_vote days_since_last_vote employee_joined_after_jun17 countdown_to_last_day reason on_leave no_leaves_till_date previous_day_leave last_2_days_leaves weekday month week 0 23729 17r 2018-05-29 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 3.0 Europe/Madrid 1.0 1 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.121212 0.0 0.0 0 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Tuesday May 1 1 23730 17r 2018-05-30 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 3.0 Europe/Madrid 1.0 1 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.121212 0.0 0.0 0 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Wednesday May 2 2 23731 17r 2018-05-31 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 3.0 Europe/Madrid 1.0 2 1.0 1.0 3.0 2.121212 0.0 0.0 1 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Thursday May 3 3 23732 17r 2018-06-01 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 3.0 Europe/Madrid 1.0 3 2.0 0.5 3.0 2.121212 0.0 3.0 0 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Friday Jun 1 4 23733 17r 2018-06-02 0.0 0.0 0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0 3.0 Europe/Madrid 1.0 4 2.0 0.5 3.0 2.121212 0.0 0.0 0 1.0 999 NaN 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Saturday Jun 2 Base model \u00b6 This data is at an employee-day level, and we can predict if any employee will take leave on any particular date. As very few employees take leave on any particular day, we will have a highly imbalanced dataset. 1 - df . on_leave . mean () 0.9514513766404592 This indicates that only 5% of the dataset contains information about employees taking leaves. This means that if we predicted that all the employees are not taking a leave (class 0), we would be 95% accurate, but such prediction is not useful. This is the base model, and we need to see to it that we have accuracy greater than 95%. Decision Tree Classifier \u00b6 from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier , plot_tree from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split , GridSearchCV , cross_val_score , KFold from sklearn.metrics import classification_report , confusion_matrix , ConfusionMatrixDisplay , accuracy_score , roc_curve , roc_auc_score From the different features that we have created, we are selecting what we think will be relevant features for predicting which employee might be absent. indep_vars = [ 'last_likes' , 'last_dislikes' , 'feedbackType' , 'likes_till_date' , 'dislikes_till_date' , 'last_2_likes' , 'last_2_dislikes' , 'days_since_last_comment' , 'last_vote' , 'timezone' , 'stillExists' , 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' , 'no_of_votes_till_date' , 'perc_days_voted' , 'avg_vote_till_date' , 'avg_vote' , 'last_2_votes_avg' , 'days_since_last_vote' , 'employee_joined_after_jun17' , 'countdown_to_last_day' , 'no_leaves_till_date' , 'weekday' , 'month' ] The dependent variable is on_leave . We are also creating dummy variables that represent categorical data. data_targets = df [ 'on_leave' ] . astype ( 'int' ) data_features = pd . get_dummies ( df [ indep_vars ], prefix = \"_\" , drop_first = True ) To prevent overfitting, we are splitting the data into test data and train data. Test data has 30% of the data (selected randomly) while the train data has the remaining 70% on which we train the model. This model is tested against the test data to validate for overfitting. x_train , x_test , y_train , y_test = train_test_split ( data_features , data_targets , test_size = .30 , random_state = 35 , \\ stratify = data_targets ) Before building an ensemble of models, we can build a decision tree model and understand if the features we have selected perform the classification reasonably. tree_clf = DecisionTreeClassifier ( random_state = 35 , max_depth = 3 , class_weight = \"balanced\" ) . fit ( x_train , y_train ) def plot_feature_importance ( model ): fs , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , figsize = ( 20 , 10 )) number_of_features = x_train . shape [ 1 ] plt . barh ( range ( number_of_features ), model . feature_importances_ , align = 'center' ) plt . yticks ( np . arange ( number_of_features ), x_train . columns ) plt . xlabel ( \"Feature Importance\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Feature\" ) plot_feature_importance ( tree_clf ) plt . figure ( figsize = ( 20 , 20 )) plot_tree ( tree_clf , fontsize = 10 , feature_names = x_train . columns ) plt . show () We can observe that the features that are important make reasonable sense. 1. Number of leaves till date : The number of leaves that an employee has taken already will affect the future leaves that a person would take 2. number of days since first vote (proxy to the employee tenure), employee_joined_after_Jun17 (proxy to newer employees) are significant, and we have seen these trends in the visualizations in the feature engineering section 3. As seen in the visualisations , employees took leaves during months like June and October which have come up as significant in the analysis We can see the model is not overfit with similar accuracy across test and train datasets. The confusion matrix is plotted below: def plot_confusion_matrix ( model , x_test , y_test ): plt . rcParams [ \"figure.figsize\" ] = ( 5 , 5 ) disp = ConfusionMatrixDisplay ( confusion_matrix = confusion_matrix ( y_test , model . predict ( x_test ), labels = model . classes_ ), display_labels = model . classes_ ) disp . plot () plt . show (); print ( 'Accuracy on train data is' , round ( tree_clf . score ( x_train , y_train ), 2 )) print ( 'Accuracy on test data is' , round ( tree_clf . score ( x_test , y_test ), 2 )) plot_confusion_matrix ( tree_clf , x_test , y_test ) Accuracy on train data is 0.81 Accuracy on test data is 0.81 y_test_pred = tree_clf . predict ( x_test ) print ( classification_report ( y_test , y_test_pred )) precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 0.80 0.89 9549 1 0.20 0.98 0.34 487 accuracy 0.81 10036 macro avg 0.60 0.89 0.61 10036 weighted avg 0.96 0.81 0.86 10036 We can observe that the precision is just 20% (on classifying when an employee will take a leave). This is due to imbalance of classes. This can be rectified by many ways, one of which includes under-sampling. For other methods, refer the blog on handling imbalanced classes . We are also using GridSearch to find the best tuning parameters and n-fold cross validation. Downsampling \u00b6 from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline , make_pipeline from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler param_grid_dt = { 'classification__criterion' : [ 'gini' , 'entropy' ], 'classification__max_depth' : [ 2 , 5 , 10 ], 'classification__max_features' :[ 0.2 , 0.5 , 0.8 ] } model_dt_p = Pipeline ([ ( 'sampling' , RandomUnderSampler ()), # While training, downsample the majority class randomly ( 'classification' , DecisionTreeClassifier ()) # Train and predict using rf classification model ]) model_dt = GridSearchCV ( model_dt_p , param_grid_dt , cv = 5 ) model_dt . fit ( x_train , y_train ) GridSearchCV(cv=5, estimator=Pipeline(steps=[('sampling', RandomUnderSampler()), ('classification', DecisionTreeClassifier())]), param_grid={'classification__criterion': ['gini', 'entropy'], 'classification__max_depth': [2, 5, 10], 'classification__max_features': [0.2, 0.5, 0.8]}) y_test_pred = model_dt . predict ( x_test ) print ( classification_report ( y_test , y_test_pred )) print ( 'Accuracy on train data is' , round ( model_dt . score ( x_train , y_train ), 2 )) print ( 'Accuracy on test data is' , round ( model_dt . score ( x_test , y_test ), 2 )) precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 0.97 0.98 9549 1 0.63 0.97 0.76 487 accuracy 0.97 10036 macro avg 0.81 0.97 0.87 10036 weighted avg 0.98 0.97 0.97 10036 Accuracy on train data is 0.97 Accuracy on test data is 0.97 Here we observe that with a simple decision tree classifier, we already reach an accuracy above 95% (base accuracy) with good precision and recall values. This model is better than our base model. We could further improve it by using ensemble methods which we will look into later in the blog. def print_stats ( model ): print ( 'Best params for the model' , model . best_params_ ) print ( 'Best score on the cross validation data' , round ( model . best_score_ , 2 )) print ( 'Accuracy on train data' , round ( model . score ( x_train , y_train ), 2 )) print ( 'Accuracy on test data' , round ( model . score ( x_test , y_test ), 2 )) print_stats ( model_dt ) plot_confusion_matrix ( model_dt , x_test , y_test ) Best params for the model {'classification__criterion': 'entropy', 'classification__max_depth': 10, 'classification__max_features': 0.5} Best score on the cross validation data 0.96 Accuracy on train data 0.97 Accuracy on test data 0.97 y_test_pred = model_dt . predict ( x_test ) print ( classification_report ( y_test , y_test_pred )) precision recall f1-score support 0 1.00 0.97 0.98 9549 1 0.63 0.97 0.76 487 accuracy 0.97 10036 macro avg 0.81 0.97 0.87 10036 weighted avg 0.98 0.97 0.97 10036 Multiple models \u00b6 After manually applying a few models, we can scale up to use grid search method to search for the best classifier and parameters in a quick and efficient manner.

Hyperopt uses a form of Bayesian optimization for parameter tuning that allows you to get the best parameters for a given model.

Different features are created across four different datasets for the same use case. Predicting absenteeism \u00b6 A large problem within organisations is how to motivate their employees. In this blog, we will use HappyForce in order to predict employment absenteeism. The goal is to identify who are likely to be absent in the near future, and find the reasons for absenteeism. This blog is the first part and contains Feature engineering and EDA for machine learning. Part 2 contains the machine learning part where we build models and compare the results. Part 3 contains modelling using neural networks. This blog shows various ways in which feature engineering can be carried out on time series datasets. We focused on data from 408 employees of one company in Spain; 62 have record of absence. The below chart summarizes the main reasons for leave; in our case, common sickness / non job-related accidents are the main reasons. Given we are to analyse employee absence as it relates to motivation, it is feasible to assume a portion of these employees simply call in sick as they lack motivation or commitment to their workplace.

This survey has data from 3-5-2017 to 11-3-2019. This survey was taken by 472 employees. While the data has details from 3-5-2017, there would be employees who joined after the survey has already started. Identifying them will help us to look for patterns over time for new employees. We are considering any employee that has the first vote 100 days after the inception (3-5-2017) as a new employee. f , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , figsize = ( 20 , 10 )) votes . vote . hist ( grid = False , ax = ax ) plt . title ( 'Histogram of the votes' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Vote' ) plt . ylabel ( 'Frequency' ) plt . show () We can observe that the default vote is 3, with more happy employees using 4 and less happy employees using 2 or 3. For the modelling, we want to create features which take only the data before the observation into account, and it is useful to have running means to capture the default characteristics of the employee, and also to capture the latest 2 votes to capture if there has been any change from the normal recently. The columns after feature engineering are: 1. (existing column) vote: what the employee voted (1 to 4, representing being very Bad, Bad, Good, Very Good) 2. new_employee: We add a new parameter called \"new employee\" - we will label someone as a newer employee if their first vote has been more than 100 days (~3 months) since the software began collecting data 3. min_date: the date of the first recorded vote by an employee 4. no_of_days_since_first_vote: we use this as proxy for tenure in the company 5. no_of_votes_till_date: use this as proxy for engagement with the company 6. perc_days_voted: another way to look at engagement with the company (adjusted for tenure) 7. avg_vote_till_date: proxy for job satisfaction (the higher, the better) 8. avg_vote: same as above, but taking all votes (not just to date) 9. last_2_votes_avg: proxy for most recent sentiment at their job # Feature engineering on the votes dataset votes [ 'min_date' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'voteDate' ] . transform ( min ) # new employee is 100 day since inception of the software votes [ 'new_employee' ] = ( votes . min_date >= '13-06-2017 00:00:00' ) . astype ( int ) # Getting the difference in days since first vote in days votes [ 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' ] = (( votes . voteDate - votes . min_date ) / np . timedelta64 ( 1 , 'D' )) . astype ( int ) + 1 # Calculating the cumulative number of votes till date (only considering the past: this step should be done after order by) votes [ 'no_of_votes_till_date' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'voteDate' ] . transform ( 'cumcount' ) + 1 # calculating the percentage of days that the employee has voted till date votes [ 'perc_days_voted' ] = votes [ 'no_of_votes_till_date' ] / votes [ 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' ] # average of the vote till date by the employee votes [ 'avg_vote_till_date' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'vote' ] . transform ( 'cumsum' ) / ( votes [ 'no_of_votes_till_date' ]) # Average vote in general of the employee votes [ 'avg_vote' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'vote' ] . transform ( np . mean ) # Converting to datetime votes [ 'date' ] = votes . voteDate . dt . date . astype ( 'datetime64[ns]' ) Last n-average \u00b6 The variable 'last_2_votes_average' is created to get the running average of the last two votes # The average of the last two votes (The last two votes might redict the probability of taking a leave now) votes = votes . sort_values ([ 'employee' , 'voteDate' ]) votes [ 'last_2_votes_avg' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' ) . vote . \\ transform ( lambda s : s . rolling ( 2 , closed = 'left' ) . mean ()) Previous vote \u00b6 The previous vote for the employee # The previous vote votes [ 'prev_vote' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' ) . vote . transform ( lambda s : s . shift ( periods = 1 )) In the scatter plot below we can see an interesting trend / relationship between votes (1 to 4) and employee tenure. We can see the newer employees (green dots) are overall more satisfied than older employees (red dots). We can also see that over time, more tenured employees show a concerning downward trend in satisfaction. This could be one of the drivers for churn or increased absences. fs , axs = plt . subplots ( 1 , figsize = ( 20 , 10 )) votes . groupby ([ 'new_employee' , 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' ]) . agg ({ 'vote' : 'mean' }) . reset_index () . \\ plot . scatter ( x = 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' , y = 'vote' , c = 'new_employee' , alpha = 0.4 , cmap = sns . diverging_palette ( 10 , 133 , as_cmap = True ), ax = axs ) #, vmin = 2.0, vmax=3.5) axs . set_ylim ([ 2 , 3.5 ]) plt . title ( 'Averge vote across new and old employee' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Number of days since first vote' ) plt . show () We can see there is some seasonality in votes.

We are also assuming that the last comment and the likes and dislikes have an effect on the employee With these assumptions, we combine the datasets.

In this blog, we will use HappyForce in order to predict employment absenteeism. The goal is to identify who are likely to be absent in the near future, and find the reasons for absenteeism. This blog is the first part and contains Feature engineering and EDA for machine learning. Part 2 contains the machine learning part where we build models and compare the results. Part 3 contains modelling using neural networks. This blog shows various ways in which feature engineering can be carried out on time series datasets. We focused on data from 408 employees of one company in Spain; 62 have record of absence. The below chart summarizes the main reasons for leave; in our case, common sickness / non job-related accidents are the main reasons. Given we are to analyse employee absence as it relates to motivation, it is feasible to assume a portion of these employees simply call in sick as they lack motivation or commitment to their workplace.","title":"Predicting absenteeism"},{"location":"Python/Machine%20Learning%20Part%201/#employee-absenteeism-dataset","text":"The datasets contains 7 files, first let us look at the employeeAbsenteeism dataset import pandas as pd import numpy as np import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from datetime import date pd . options . display . max_columns = None df = pd . read_csv ( 'employeeAbsenteeism.csv' ) df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } employee companyAlias from to reason 0 19Q C1 10/1/18 0:10 10/26/18 0:10 Workplace accident 1 NY3 C1 10/1/18 0:10 10/31/18 0:10 Common sickness or accident not related to th... 2 qKO C1 10/1/18 0:10 10/5/18 0:10 Common sickness or accident not related to th... 3 qKO C1 10/10/18 0:10 10/31/18 0:10 Common sickness or accident not related to th... 4 2wx C1 10/1/18 0:10 10/31/18 0:10 Common sickness or accident not related to th...","title":"Employee absenteeism dataset"},{"location":"Python/Machine%20Learning%20Part%201/#convert-strings-in-different-formats-to-datetime","text":"The columns 'from' and 'to' are date time values in unspecified format. df . to = pd . to_datetime ( df . to ) # converts string to type datetime df [ 'from' ] = pd . to_datetime ( df [ 'from' ]) df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } employee companyAlias from to reason 0 19Q C1 2018-10-01 00:10:00 2018-10-26 00:10:00 Workplace accident 1 NY3 C1 2018-10-01 00:10:00 2018-10-31 00:10:00 Common sickness or accident not related to th... 2 qKO C1 2018-10-01 00:10:00 2018-10-05 00:10:00 Common sickness or accident not related to th... 3 qKO C1 2018-10-10 00:10:00 2018-10-31 00:10:00 Common sickness or accident not related to th... 4 2wx C1 2018-10-01 00:10:00 2018-10-31 00:10:00 Common sickness or accident not related to th...

While the data has details from 3-5-2017, there would be employees who joined after the survey has already started. Identifying them will help us to look for patterns over time for new employees.

For the modelling, we want to create features which take only the data before the observation into account, and it is useful to have running means to capture the default characteristics of the employee, and also to capture the latest 2 votes to capture if there has been any change from the normal recently. The columns after feature engineering are: 1. (existing column) vote: what the employee voted (1 to 4, representing being very Bad, Bad, Good, Very Good) 2. new_employee: We add a new parameter called \"new employee\" - we will label someone as a newer employee if their first vote has been more than 100 days (~3 months) since the software began collecting data 3. min_date: the date of the first recorded vote by an employee 4. no_of_days_since_first_vote: we use this as proxy for tenure in the company 5. no_of_votes_till_date: use this as proxy for engagement with the company 6. perc_days_voted: another way to look at engagement with the company (adjusted for tenure) 7. avg_vote_till_date: proxy for job satisfaction (the higher, the better) 8. avg_vote: same as above, but taking all votes (not just to date) 9. last_2_votes_avg: proxy for most recent sentiment at their job # Feature engineering on the votes dataset votes [ 'min_date' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'voteDate' ] . transform ( min ) # new employee is 100 day since inception of the software votes [ 'new_employee' ] = ( votes . min_date >= '13-06-2017 00:00:00' ) . astype ( int ) # Getting the difference in days since first vote in days votes [ 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' ] = (( votes . voteDate - votes . min_date ) / np . timedelta64 ( 1 , 'D' )) . astype ( int ) + 1 # Calculating the cumulative number of votes till date (only considering the past: this step should be done after order by) votes [ 'no_of_votes_till_date' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'voteDate' ] . transform ( 'cumcount' ) + 1 # calculating the percentage of days that the employee has voted till date votes [ 'perc_days_voted' ] = votes [ 'no_of_votes_till_date' ] / votes [ 'no_of_days_since_first_vote' ] # average of the vote till date by the employee votes [ 'avg_vote_till_date' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'vote' ] . transform ( 'cumsum' ) / ( votes [ 'no_of_votes_till_date' ]) # Average vote in general of the employee votes [ 'avg_vote' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' )[ 'vote' ] . transform ( np . mean ) # Converting to datetime votes [ 'date' ] = votes . voteDate . dt . date . astype ( 'datetime64[ns]' )","title":"Votes dataset"},{"location":"Python/Machine%20Learning%20Part%201/#last-n-average","text":"The variable 'last_2_votes_average' is created to get the running average of the last two votes # The average of the last two votes (The last two votes might redict the probability of taking a leave now) votes = votes . sort_values ([ 'employee' , 'voteDate' ]) votes [ 'last_2_votes_avg' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' ) . vote . \\ transform ( lambda s : s . rolling ( 2 , closed = 'left' ) . mean ())","title":"Last n-average"},{"location":"Python/Machine%20Learning%20Part%201/#previous-vote","text":"The previous vote for the employee # The previous vote votes [ 'prev_vote' ] = votes . groupby ( 'employee' ) . vote . transform ( lambda s : s . shift ( periods = 1 )) In the scatter plot below we can see an interesting trend / relationship between votes (1 to 4) and employee tenure. We can see the newer employees (green dots) are overall more satisfied than older employees (red dots). We can also see that over time, more tenured employees show a concerning downward trend in satisfaction.

The complete ARIMA model is discussed in a different blog post. The final results of the model are shown below: Deployment \u00b6 The best way to deploy the machine learning model (according to me) is to encapsulate the training and prediction logic behind the data science model along with the final model in an object. This can be done using a class as shown below. This object can be serialised/deserialised, and we need not re-write the prediction logic on the server-side every time we change the machine learning model or code. We can only change the final model file, and the application should work seamlessly. We are effectively removing the machine learning from the server-side code and instead encapsulating it on an object. Consider the below code, which encapsulates the machine learning model: import dill # dill is an alternative to pickle which is better for serialising objects along with their class definitions class predict_pm25 : def __init__ ( self ): self . model = None self . version = 1 def predict ( self , date ): # This predict function can have anything import requests import pandas as pd import numpy as np from math import sqrt import datetime from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta # Getting the actual and predictions of the last two days for ARIMA(2,0,2) date = ( datetime . datetime . strptime ( date , \"%Y-%m- %d \" ) - relativedelta ( days = 2 )) . strftime ( \"%Y-%m- %d \" ) response = requests . get ( \"https://hydpm25.herokuapp.com/get_last_n_days_data\" , params = { 'date' : date , 'n' : 2 }) df = pd .

First, we set up flask server over local host. First, write the following code in a file named flask_app.py (any name except flask.py) # File flask_app.py from flask import Flask , request , jsonify import pandas as pd from mc_predict import predict as machine_learning_predict # has code for the predict function app = Flask ( __name__ ) # initialising the flask app @app . route ( \"/\" ) # specifying the app route over the web def base_website (): # what should happen at this route return \"Welcome to machine learning model APIs!\" @app . route ( '/predict' , methods = [ 'GET' ]) # Get request defined def predict_request (): # what should happen at this get request json_ = request . json query_df = pd . DataFrame ( json_ ) prediction = machine_learning_predict ( query_df ) # we call the predict function for the machine learning model return jsonify ({ 'prediction' : list ( prediction )}) if __name__ == '__main__' : app . run ( debug = True ) The predict function is defined in a different file called mc_predict.py . In this function, we load (unserialise) the saved model and call the predict function in the model. Here we can observe that this is a function on the server, and it does not contain any machine learning logic. All the machine learning logic is present in the object, and changing the object can change the machine learning logic without changing this code. # File mc_predict.py import dill def predict ( date = '2021-11-12' ): with open ( 'predict_hyderabad_pm25.pkl' , \"rb\" ) as pkl_file : model = dill . load ( pkl_file ) # unserialise the model return model . predict ( date ) For example, the prediction for '2021-11-12' is predict () array([142.32741472]) That's it. We have our local deployment ready. We will have to go to the folder where these files are present and type 'python flask_app.py'. We will get the app running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ . Pythonanywhere \u00b6 The next step is to deploy it on pythonanywhere. The first step is to sign up for a new account. We can then \"Add a new web app\" with Flask 3.7. This will create a default flask based web app with your username.pythonanywhere.com. We can install any packages necessary using the \"Console\" (example pip install dill). In the files tab, under 'mysite', are the flask files. These should be replaced with the files that we have above. The model file should also be uploaded. (We should take care of the relative location of the model file while loading it). Under 'Web' tab, we can 'Reload the model', which will rebuild the application. We now have our machine learning model deployed. I can access the API GET request at https://harshaash.pythonanywhere.com/predict with the parameter date=YYYY-MM-DD.

All the machine learning logic is present in the object, and changing the object can change the machine learning logic without changing this code. # File mc_predict.py import dill def predict ( date = '2021-11-12' ): with open ( 'predict_hyderabad_pm25.pkl' , \"rb\" ) as pkl_file : model = dill . load ( pkl_file ) # unserialise the model return model . predict ( date ) For example, the prediction for '2021-11-12' is predict () array([142.32741472]) That's it.

There are two types of flow maximisation problems: 1. Max flow: What is the maximum flow that can be sent from source to output without exceeding capacity. 2. Min cost flow: We have the cost along with capacities on each edge. We want to find the minimum cost path of sending f uits of flow from source to outflow. We can use integer programming to solve both these problems. import networkx as nx # Other packages for manupulating data import numpy as np import pandas as pd # packages for plotting import matplotlib.pyplot as plt Maximum flow problem \u00b6 Let us first consider the max flow problem.

Network science is the study of such complex networks. There is some common phenomenon that applies to social networks: How do networks evolve \u00b6 A social network is constantly evolving; people make new friends and lose touch with other friends. Many external factors in life, like marriage, new college, school, workplace or club, can spark the creation of new friends. This phenomenon is observed in vast networks such as the internet. Is there any model that can explain the growth of networks? If so, we can simulate new networks, identify what parameters influence the growth of new networks etc. Power law explains some real-world examples of the growth and scale of networks. Small World Phenomena \u00b6 Small world phenomenon states that everyone in the world can be reached through a short chain of acquaintances. This was first demonstrated in the Milgram experiment where random people were asked to send a letter to a stockbroker in Boston by passing it through people they know. Of the letters received, they went through an average of 6 people. Facebook repeated this on a large scale later, which validated this with a lower number of connections. This indicates that most people are connected to every other random person on earth within six common friends. Homophily \u00b6 This can be described as \"Birds of a feather flock together\". We tend to be friends with friends who are similar to us, especially people from the same socio-economic background, social background, etc. Strength of weak ties \u00b6 If two people in a social network have a friend in common, then there is an increased likelihood that they will become friends at some point in the future. This also depends on the strength of the friendship(ties). Generally, people in the same network will have the same kind of information. Take an example of jobs; everyone in the same friend circle will have the same information about open positions for jobs. It is the weak ties, friends whom we have not interacted with within some time, who have new information which will help most people to find jobs. This is called as the strength of weak ties. Let us look at a small network of friends in Zachary karate club . Zachary's karate club is a university-based karate club consisting of a social network of 34 members. W.W. Zachary famously observed the karate club for three years (from 1970 to 1972), documenting links between pairs of members who interacted outside the everyday activities of the club. The nodes in the graph represent people, and the edges represent friendships (interactions) between them. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt % matplotlib inline import networkx as nx G = nx . karate_club_graph () nx . draw_kamada_kawai ( G , with_labels = True ) We can understand the network using some statistics about the network. Network Statistics \u00b6 Degree Distribution \u00b6 The degree of a node is the number of nodes a particular node is connected to. For example, node 11 has one degree in the karate club network as it is connected to one node only(node 0). The degree distribution is the relative frequencies of the nodes that have particular degrees. There are two types of degree distributions generally, Poisson and scale-free. For the karate club network, the degree distribution is: degree_dist = nx . degree_histogram ( G ) plt . bar ( range ( len ( degree_dist )), degree_dist ) plt . ylabel ( 'No of people' ) plt . xlabel ( 'No of friends' ); This indicates that most people have 2-5 friends while a few people are connected to >15 people in the network. Clustering coefficient \u00b6 Another statistic that we can understand is the clustering coefficient. This is the degree to which nodes cluster together. If A is friends with B and C, then B and c have a high probability of being friends if they belong to the same cluster. The clustering coefficient captures the fraction of triads (connected A, B and C) in the network. The clustering coefficient of all the nodes is calculated. The clustering coefficient of a node is the percentage of triangles that are there among the nodes that it is connected to. For example, node 11 is connected to node 6 and 5, both of which are connected. So the percentage of triads is 100%. Node 4 is connected to 0, 6 and 10. 0-6-4 and 0-10-0 make a triad, but 0-10-4 does not exist. Therefore, the percentage is 66.6%. The clustering coefficient of the network is the average of the clustering coefficient across all the nodes, and it is 57% for the karate club. nx . clustering ( G ) {0: 0.15, 1: 0.3333333333333333, 2: 0.24444444444444444, 3: 0.6666666666666666, 4: 0.6666666666666666, 5: 0.5, 6: 0.5, 7: 1.0, 8: 0.5, 9: 0, 10: 0.6666666666666666, 11: 0, 12: 1.0, 13: 0.6, 14: 1.0, 15: 1.0, 16: 1.0, 17: 1.0, 18: 1.0, 19: 0.3333333333333333, 20: 1.0, 21: 1.0, 22: 1.0, 23: 0.4, 24: 0.3333333333333333, 25: 0.3333333333333333, 26: 1.0, 27: 0.16666666666666666, 28: 0.3333333333333333, 29: 0.6666666666666666, 30: 0.5, 31: 0.2, 32: 0.19696969696969696, 33: 0.11029411764705882} nx . algorithms . cluster . average_clustering ( G ) 0.5706384782076823 Community Detection \u00b6 During the study in Karate club, a conflict arose between the club president 'A' and instructor 'B' (pseudonyms), which led to a split in the club. Half of the members formed a new club around A (group one) and the remaining members under B. Can we identify the 2 communities in this network? Girvan Newman \u00b6 Community detection is close to clustering in machine learning. In clustering, we do the clustering based on the distance between the points when placed in an n-dimensional space. Similar to clustering, in community detection, we want to cluster the nodes closer to each other than others. The only difference is the concept of distance is based on the topology of the network. Like clustering, we can divide the network into two communities using top-down and bottom-up methods. This is represented by a dendrogram where we can draw a horizontal line to split the communities. This is discussed in more detail in a different blog. The two groups based on Girvan Newman are: karate_club_split = nx . algorithms . community . centrality . girvan_newman ( G ) karate_club_split_tuple = tuple ( sorted ( c ) for c in next ( karate_club_split )) karate_club_split_tuple ([0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 19, 21], [2, 8, 9, 14, 15, 18, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]) # To get colors in the graph color_list = [ 'r' if node in karate_club_split_tuple [ 0 ] else 'g' for node in G . nodes ] nx . draw_kamada_kawai ( G , node_color = color_list , with_labels = True ) Ratio cut \u00b6 Another method is the ratio cut method. A cut is a set of edges such that if we remove them, the network breaks into two components. A network will have many cuts, and to find an optimal split, we need to: 1. Find the min-balanced-cut (cut with the minimum number of edges with an almost equal number of nodes on each side) among all pairs of nodes 2. Repeat over each of the two parts This is discussed in more detail in a different blog. References \u00b6 Zachary, W. W. (1977). An Information Flow Model for Conflict and Fission in Small Groups.

For this example, \u201cemail-Eu-core network,\u201d from Stanford\u2019s SNAP is used. You may find the original dataset here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html . This is a dataset of various email communications between people, and we are interested about the important people, leaders and opinion makers in this network. import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import networkx as nx % matplotlib inline For the purposes of this blog, I am filtering the data only for the first 100 people for brevity. Same analysis can be done across the complete dataset. df = pd . read_csv ( \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jinhangjiang/Datasets/main/Network%20Data/emailEUcore/email-Eu-core.txt\" , delimiter = \" \" , names = [ \"Source\" , \"Target\" ]) df = df . loc [( df .

G = nx . from_pandas_edgelist ( df , source = 'Source' , target = 'Target' , create_using = nx . DiGraph ()) plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 20 , 20 )) plt . title ( 'Email, EU-Core network' ) nx . draw_kamada_kawai ( G , with_labels = True ) We can see that there are two densely connected networks and many connections between them. Who is the most important person in the network? This is based on what is the question you are asking. Is it the person who can send the emails the fastest? Is it the person why can connect with maximum number of people? Some basic features would be: 1. Just by the number of mails sent/received, who has sent the maximum number of mails 2. By the number of people that a person has an immediate relation with (a relation is defined as sending an email to that person): degree centrality 3. We can also look at the persons who are essential for communication between different closely knit groups. (betweenness centrality) The person with the maximum number of interactions is: student_sent_mails = list ( df . groupby ( 'Source' )[ 'Target' ] . count ()) student_sent_mails . index ( max ( student_sent_mails )) + 1 86 We can say that the person with index 86 has the most number of interactions and is one of the most important persons. He would be the go-to person who has connections with maximum number of people. We can see this in the graph also. Degree centrality \u00b6 This way of looking at the importance of a person based on number of connections (Degrees) is called degree centrality. In ascending order, the top 10 people with maximum number of connections are: degree_centrality = nx . algorithms . centrality . degree_centrality ( G ) for i , w in enumerate ( sorted ( degree_centrality , key = degree_centrality . get , reverse = True )): if ( i < 10 ): print ( w , degree_centrality [ w ]) else : break 86 0.8282828282828284 62 0.7676767676767677 82 0.6464646464646465 96 0.6161616161616162 28 0.6060606060606061 21 0.5555555555555556 13 0.5353535353535354 23 0.5151515151515152 30 0.494949494949495 64 0.494949494949495 This network can be visualised with most size proportional to the importance according to degree centrality. plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 20 , 20 )) plt . title ( 'Email, EU-Core network: degree centrality' ) nx . draw_kamada_kawai ( G , with_labels = True , node_size = list ( np . array ( list ( degree_centrality . values ())) * 500 )) Betweenness centrality \u00b6 Although person 86 has sent mails to the maximum number of people, he has still sent mails to only 45 out of the 100 people. This means if we want to send a mail to the whole class, that there might be other important people through whom the remaining people receive mails. We should identify people who are part of different closely knit groups and who are essential for passing information between groups. This is given by betweenness centrality. The most important people according to this metric in descending order are: btw_centrality = nx . algorithms . centrality . betweenness_centrality ( G ) for i , w in enumerate ( sorted ( btw_centrality . items (), key = lambda item : item [ 1 ], reverse = True )): if ( i < 10 ): print ( w ) else : break (86, 0.14149427475629858) (62, 0.12154539177634052) (96, 0.08160276331043798) (82, 0.0670387255089669) (64, 0.06502342115189583) (21, 0.05061277358840613) (13, 0.04673865990243992) (44, 0.04327552467861193) (5, 0.0412363399245883) (28, 0.03679924185307917) plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 20 , 20 )) plt . title ( 'Email, EU-Core network: betweenness centrality' ) nx . draw_kamada_kawai ( G , with_labels = True , node_size = list ( np . array ( list ( btw_centrality . values ())) * 5000 )) We get the same people at the top, nut this time including a few additional people. Page rank (Eigenvector centrality) \u00b6 Another way to identify the important people in a network is to not only look at the number of people who are connected to the person but also the importance of the people whom they are connected to. The importance of the person can be defined as proportional to the sum of importance of the immediate people connected to him/her. This is defined by eigenvector centrality. Below is the top ten people who are important based on who they know and whom they are connected to: ev_centrality = nx . algorithms . centrality . eigenvector_centrality ( G ) for i , w in enumerate ( sorted ( ev_centrality . items (), key = lambda item : item [ 1 ], reverse = True )): if ( i < 10 ): print ( w ) else : break (28, 0.25779806388704485) (23, 0.2412215124270137) (30, 0.21579251773540695) (62, 0.2061936996975851) (29, 0.1962488726486241) (35, 0.19522994610327346) (86, 0.18934292971595598) (27, 0.1823911579409791) (96, 0.18188010730196982) (40, 0.1803640484660976) plt . subplots ( figsize = ( 20 , 20 )) plt . title ( 'Email, EU-Core network: eigenvector centrality' ) nx . draw_kamada_kawai ( G , with_labels = True , node_size = list ( np . array ( list ( ev_centrality . values ())) * 2500 )) Clustering coefficient \u00b6 Any graph in general can be densely connected or sparsely connected. The behaviour of the graph, and therefore the actions that have to be taken, are different for sparse graphs vs densely connected graphs. The betweenness measures above should be looked at along with clustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient is a way of measuring the degree to which the nodes in a graph cluster together. Networks with high number of clustering coefficient are more social. The average clustering coefficient for the graph is (assuming an undirected graph): G_undir = nx . from_pandas_edgelist ( df , source = 'Source' , target = 'Target' ) nx . algorithms . cluster . average_clustering ( G_undir ) 0.5130839320504162 From the above analysis, we can find the most important people in the network. The people who have the most connections, the people who are part of multiple groups and are important to send message across and the people who are important based on whom they know immediately.

Who is the most important person in the network? This is based on what is the question you are asking. Is it the person who can send the emails the fastest? Is it the person why can connect with maximum number of people? Some basic features would be: 1. Just by the number of mails sent/received, who has sent the maximum number of mails 2. By the number of people that a person has an immediate relation with (a relation is defined as sending an email to that person): degree centrality 3. We can also look at the persons who are essential for communication between different closely knit groups. (betweenness centrality) The person with the maximum number of interactions is: student_sent_mails = list ( df . groupby ( 'Source' )[ 'Target' ] . count ()) student_sent_mails . index ( max ( student_sent_mails )) + 1 86 We can say that the person with index 86 has the most number of interactions and is one of the most important persons. He would be the go-to person who has connections with maximum number of people.

This blog uses the data of 10k users (taken randomly) from the NetEase dataset to increase the click-through rate on the music cards (similar to TikTok/Instagram reels) recommended to the users. Recommending trending music to each unique user can decrease the chances of the user being inactive and increases the time spent by a user on the app. Collaborative filtering creates item and user embeddings to understand the behaviour of different users and items. Neural Collaborative Filtering is modified to incorporate these other features as we have additional content-based and user-based features.

Embeddings \u00b6 We create user and content embeddings using neural networks. An embedding is a lower dimensional space that captures the relationships from higher dimensions. Each axis in an embedding could indicate one attribute/trait of the user/content/higher dimension. For example, for the content, one of the axes could represent classical music while the other could represent rock music, and so on. We have considered user and content embeddings of eight dimensions. A larger number of dimensions means more model complexity, but it would also allow us to capture the traits more accurately. import torch from torch.utils.data import Dataset # creating the dataset class NetEaseTrainDataset ( Dataset ): \"\"\"NetEase PyTorch Dataset for Training \"\"\" def __init__ ( self , users , items , lables , con_var_list ): self . users , self . items , self . lables , self . con_var_list = self . get_dataset ( users , items , lables , con_var_list ) def __len__ ( self ): return len ( self . users ) def __getitem__ ( self , idx ): return self . users [ idx ], self . items [ idx ], self . lables [ idx ], self . con_var_list [ idx ] def get_dataset ( self , users , items , lables , con_var_list ): return torch . tensor ( users ), torch . tensor ( items ), torch . tensor ( lables ), torch . tensor ( con_var_list ) . float () Integrating continuous variables \u00b6 Consider the following training sample to walk through the architecture. train_data [[ 'userId' , 'mlogId' ] + cont_vars + [ 'isClick' ]] . loc [ 0 ] userId PCNCGCGCLCOCOCOCJCGC mlogId NCLCPCJCOCGCJC user_registered_month_count 0.304348 user_follow_count 0.00346 user_level 0.6 user_gender 0.0 userImprssionCount 0.042437 userClickCount 0.167085 publishTime 0.258216 creator_registered_month_count 0.05 creator_followed 0.000004 creator_level 0.5 creator_gender 1.0 isClick 0 Name: 0, dtype: object In the training sample, we can see the userId converted to a vector (with a length of the number of users and one indicating which user) in the model. This is the input to the user embedding layer, which converts it into a vector of length 4 (user embedding). A similar process happens with the Items also. The scaled user and item features directly input the fully connected layers. The input for the fully connected layers is the concatenation of the user embeddings, item embeddings and user and item features. A sigmoid function is applied at the output layer to obtain the most probable class. In the example, the most probable class is 0. import torch.nn as nn # !pip install pytorch_lightning import pytorch_lightning as pl from torch.utils.data import DataLoader class NCF ( pl .

This blog uses the data of 10k users (taken randomly) from the NetEase dataset to increase the click-through rate on the music cards (similar to TikTok/Instagram reels) recommended to the users. Recommending trending music to each unique user can decrease the chances of the user being inactive and increases the time spent by a user on the app. Collaborative filtering creates item and user embeddings to understand the behaviour of different users and items. Neural Collaborative Filtering is modified to incorporate these other features as we have additional content-based and user-based features. This approach can use the power of collaborative filtering to create user and item embeddings independently and, simultaneously, use the additional content and user-based features given in the data for building the model. import pandas as pd import datetime import numpy as np import random import warnings warnings . filterwarnings ( 'ignore' ) The data for the most recent day the user has interacted is taken as a test set, while the rest is used for training the data.

We could integrate this to a web server so that our web server can talk to our database. Flask web app \u00b6 In this blog, we will be using a python web server called Flask . Flask is simple, light and customisable that can generate simple web apps with a few pages, read/set cookies and connect to databases using ORM's. To use the ORM, we have to first develop a flask app. One of the important things to set up in an ORM is the list of models. Models are python objects that map onto entities in the database. For example, we want a historic_pollution table with a row for each date in the past. The ORM object will generate python objects for each row allowing us to easily work with rows in python rather than in SQL. One of the main jobs of the ORM is to notice changes of the python object and construct SQL statements to automatically modify the database accordingly. The flask app is present in the GitHub repository flask-web-app with the complete code discussed here. Inside the app folder, we have a file called models.py . This holds our database models, and tells us how Python is going to translate between data in the database tables and python objects. We are defining two python classes here. Each of them maps directly onto a table in the database. Each of the lines inside the class tells how to treat one of the columns in the database. For instance, we have date, type and value in the daily_historic_pollution table, and for each of them we have to tell SqlAlchemy the type. We can also mention the primary key, index and unique columns etc. This file allows SqlAlchemy to do two things: 1. Read from the database 2. Build SQL statements and execute them # File models.py from app import db from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship from sqlalchemy import Table , Column , Integer , ForeignKey class Historic ( db .

In a previous blog , I have demonstrated how we can deploy a flask application using pythonanywhere which predicts the pollution using a machine learning model that I built. In this blog, we will see how we can store this information in a database to be used either for visualisation or other analytics. Free database on ElephantSQL \u00b6 Elephant SQL automates setup and running of PostgreSQL clusters. They have a free plan called \"Tiny turtle\" which gives us 5 concurrent connections and 20 MB of data. This is sufficient for storing our data. Using the free plan, we can create an instance called \"hydpm25\" (For Hyderabad PM25 data) Creating tables \u00b6 Once we have a cluster created, we can create tables in three ways. 1. Using SQL commands on \"SQL Browser\" 2. Using psycopg2 in Python 3. Using SQLAlchemy SQL Queries \u00b6 First, let us create a table using SQL Browser. For creating a new table \"daily_historic_pollution\" which will contain the historic pollution data of Hyderabad we can use the following query. CREATE DATABASE hyderabad_aqi ; CREATE TABLE daily_historic_pollution ( date DATE PRIMARY KEY , type VARCHAR ( 20 ), value FLOAT ); Load data using python \u00b6 We can use psycopg to connect and create the same table. The URL to connect is provided by ElephantSQL under \"Details\". After connecting to the database, we can create tables using SQL commands. import psycopg2 connection_string = \"postgresql://username:password@hostname:hostnumber/database\" conn = psycopg2 . connect ( connection_string ) conn . set_session ( autocommit = True ) cur = conn . cursor () cur . execute ( \"\"\" DROP TABLE IF EXISTS daily_historic_pollution \"\"\" ) cur . execute ( \"\"\" CREATE TABLE daily_historic_pollution (date DATE PRIMARY KEY, type VARCHAR(20), value INTEGER ) \"\"\" ) print ( \"Created table\" ) cur . close () conn . close () Created table SqlAlchemy \u00b6 According to me, the best way to interface with a database is using SqlAlchemy. For example, consider the data from AQICN's API on the air pollution data for Hyderabad. import pandas as pd df = pd . read_csv ( 'hyderabad-us consulate, india-air-quality.csv' ) df [ 'type' ] = 'pm25' df . columns = [ 'date' , 'value' , 'type' ] df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } date value type 0 2021/10/1 87 pm25 1 2021/10/2 47 pm25 2 2021/10/3 50 pm25 3 2021/9/1 66 pm25 4 2021/9/2 74 pm25 Using SqlAlchemy, we can upload this data to the previously created table. from sqlalchemy import create_engine import numpy from psycopg2.extensions import register_adapter , AsIs def addapt_numpy_float64 ( numpy_float64 ): return AsIs ( numpy_float64 ) def addapt_numpy_int64 ( numpy_int64 ): return AsIs ( numpy_int64 ) register_adapter ( numpy . float64 , addapt_numpy_float64 ) register_adapter ( numpy . int64 , addapt_numpy_int64 ) engine = create_engine ( connection_string ) for i in range ( len ( df )): query = \"\"\"INSERT INTO daily_historic_pollution (date, type, value) VALUES( %s , %s , %s ) ON CONFLICT (date) DO UPDATE SET type = excluded.type, value = excluded.value; \"\"\" engine . execute ( query , ( df . date [ i ], df . type [ i ], df . value [ i ])) HTTP requests \u00b6 In this way, we can load data into a database. Now I want to create a new table that can store the predictions from the flask application into a table. conn = psycopg2 . connect ( connection_string ) conn . set_session ( autocommit = True ) cur = conn . cursor () cur . execute ( \"\"\" DROP TABLE IF EXISTS daily_prediction_pollution \"\"\" ) cur . execute ( \"\"\" CREATE TABLE daily_prediction_pollution (date DATE PRIMARY KEY, type VARCHAR(20), prediction FLOAT ) \"\"\" ) print ( \"Created table\" ) cur . close () conn . close () Created table We can use the GET request from the flask application in the previous blog to predict PM25 for the date. import requests from datetime import date , datetime today = str ( date . today () . year ) + '-' + str ( date . today () . month ) + '-' + str ( date . today () . day ) response = requests . get ( \"https://harshaash.pythonanywhere.com/predict\" , params = { 'date' : today }) response . json ()[ 'prediction' ][ 0 ] 115.6 The prediction is 115.6 PM25. We can use our knowledge on SqlAlchemy to store this value in a database. query2 = \"\"\"INSERT INTO daily_prediction_pollution (date, type, prediction) VALUES( %s , %s , %s ) ON CONFLICT (date) DO UPDATE SET type = excluded.type, prediction = excluded.prediction; \"\"\" engine . execute ( query2 , ( today , 'pm25' , response . json ()[ 'prediction' ][ 0 ])) We can see this result in the database We can get actual pollution data for the past from JSON API of AQICN.org .

There are infinite ways to visualise the data, and what works is dependent on the patterns in the data. In this post, we are trying to categorise the visualisation of data for regression and classification problems. Every regression, classification and clustering problem has some or all of the following assumptions: 1. Change in independent variables changes the dependent variable. In other words, there is a relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Before building a model, it is advised to visualise this relationship. 2. Assumptions on the distribution of the dependent or independent variable. For example, for Naive Bayes classifier, the independent variables should follow a normal distribution. 3. Assumptions of relationships between independent variables. For example, for linear regression, the independent variables should not be correlated. 4. Unbalanced dataset. The frequency of the smaller class should be significant when compared to the frequency of the larger class. 5. The time series of data/features are stationary. Apart from validating the assumptions and identifying trends in the data, data visualisation can also be used for gathering insights and feature engineering. The below example is from the marketing department of a consulting firm. The problem is to identify the projects that they can win. # Ignore future deprecation warnings import warnings warnings . filterwarnings ( 'ignore' , category = DeprecationWarning ) # Importing the necessary libraries import pandas as pd import numpy as np import os import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot import mosaic import seaborn as sns % matplotlib inline # loading the data path = \"data/marketing dept.csv\" df = pd . read_csv ( path ) df . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } reporting_status product industry region strength_in_segment profit_for_customer sales_value profit_perc joint_bid_portion 0 Lost F Cap Oth 57 1.225 6.5 64 59 1 Lost L Def UK 51 1.469 9.9 56 58 2 Lost Lo Cli UK 79 0.887 7.0 59 48 3 Lost G Fin UK 55 1.316 8.9 34 41 4 Won G Sec UK 32 1.010 5.7 43 63 Univariate analysis \u00b6 The univariate analysis deals with EDA on one variable alone. In describing or characterising the observations of an individual variable, three basic properties are of interest: 1. The location of observations and how large or small the values of the individual observations are 2. The dispersion (sometimes called scale or spread) of the observations 3. The distribution of the observations Uni-variate plots provide one way to find out about those properties. There are two basic kinds of univariate plots: 1. Enumeration plots, or plots that show every observation 2. Summary plots that generalise the data into a simplified representation 3. Enumerative plots Index Plot/Univariate Scatter Diagram \u00b6 The most common enumerative plot is the index plot. It displays the values of a single variable for each observation using symbols plotted relative to the observation number. plt . plot ( df . sales_value , 'o' , color = '#86BC25' , alpha = 0.5 ) plt . title ( \"Index plot\" ) plt . ylabel ( 'Sales Value' ) plt . xlabel ( 'Index' ); From the above plot, we can infer that there are around 3000 observations for sales, and they are captured randomly along the data. Strip Plot/Strip Chart (univariate scatter diagram) \u00b6 Displays the values of a single variable as symbols plotted along a line. This is a basic plot where we can see the spread of the data. ax = sns . stripplot ( x = df . sales_value , color = '#86BC25' ) ax . set ( xlabel = 'Sales_value' , title = 'Strip Chart' ); Dot Plot/Dot Chart \u00b6 The dot plot displays the values plotted along a line. It is generally constructed after sorting the rows. This can help us in determining the distribution of the data. It can also help us identify the continuity of the data. plt . plot ( df . sort_values ( by = 'sales_value' ) . reset_index () . sales_value , 'o' , color = '#86BC25' ) plt . title ( \"Dot plot\" ) plt . ylabel ( 'Sales Value' ); From looking at the plot, most of the data lies within 6-12 while the frequency of the data decreases as we go away from the mean. The graph is also symmetric. This indicates the distribution could be Normal distribution. Univariate Summary Plots \u00b6 Summary plots display an object or a graph that gives a more concise expression of the location, dispersion, and distribution of a variable than an enumerative plot, but this comes at the expense of some loss of information: In a summary plot, it is no longer possible to retrieve the individual data value, but the gain usually matches this loss in understanding that results from the efficient representation of the data. Summary plots generally prove to be much better than enumerative plots in revealing the distribution of the data. Box plot \u00b6 A simple way of representing statistical data on a plot in which a rectangle is drawn to represent the second and third quartiles, usually with a vertical line inside to indicate the median value. The lower and upper quartiles are shown as horizontal lines on either side of the rectangle. ax = sns . boxplot ( x = df . sales_value , color = '#86BC25' ) ax . set ( xlabel = 'Sales value' , title = 'Box Chart' ); Histograms \u00b6 The other summary plots are of various types: Histograms: Histograms are a type of bar chart that displays the counts or relative frequencies of values falling in different class intervals or ranges. Density Plots: A density plot is a plot of the local relative frequency or density of points along the number line or x-axis of a plot. Where points occur more frequently, this sum, and consequently the local density, will be greater. # For continuous data ax = df . sales_value . plot . hist ( alpha = 0.75 , color = '#86BC25' ) df . groupby ( 'sales_value' )[ 'sales_value' ] . count () . plot () ax . set ( xlabel = 'Sales value' , title = 'Histogram' ); Q-Q plot \u00b6 In statistics, a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on the line y = x. If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line y = x. Q-Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions. A Q-Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions. Below is a Q-Q plot of the sales data with a normal distribution from scipy import stats stats . probplot ( df . sales_value , plot = sns . mpl . pyplot ); From the above plot, it is clear that the distribution is normal. Bar chart \u00b6 Whereas the above plots are applicable for continuous data, a simple bar chart can help us with categorical data. df . groupby ( 'region' )[ 'region' ] . count () . plot . bar ( color = '#86BC25' ) . set ( xlabel = 'Sales value' , title = 'Histogram' ); Bivariate analysis \u00b6 The bivariate analysis deals with visualisations between two variables. The bi-variate analysis is used to identify the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The dependent and independent variables can be of the following types: Problem Independent var Dependent var Plot type Classification Categorical Categorical Mosaic Plots, Stacked bar charts Classification Continuous Categorical Joint histograms Regression Categorical Continuous Box charts Regression Continuous Continuous Scatter Plots For all four types, we want to identify the relation between the dependent variable and the independent variable. Classification Visualisations \u00b6 First, let us consider the classification problem. Let's say we have to predict the reporting status of the bid. We have three categorical independent variables and five continuous independent variables. Joint Histograms \u00b6 The five continuous variables are: 1. Strength in the segment 2. Profit for customer 3. Sales Value 4. Profit percentage 5. joint bid portion For these variables, we can look at joint histograms. What we are trying to see is the overlap between the distributions for the two different classes. If the overlap between the two variables is small, then that variable can be a good predictor and vice versa. bi_con_cat = df . groupby ([ 'reporting_status' ])[ 'strength_in_segment' ] . plot . hist ( alpha = 0.5 ) plt . xlabel ( 'strength_in_segment' ) plt . legend ( df . groupby ([ 'reporting_status' ])[ 'strength_in_segment' ] . count () . axes [ 0 ] . tolist ()) plt . title ( 'Joint histogram' ); bi_con_cat = df . groupby ([ 'reporting_status' ])[ 'profit_for_customer' ] . plot . hist ( alpha = 0.5 ) plt . xlabel ( 'profit_for_customer' ) plt . legend ( df . groupby ([ 'reporting_status' ])[ 'profit_for_customer' ] . count () . axes [ 0 ] . tolist ()) plt . title ( 'Joint histogram' ); From the above graphs, we can see that profit for the customer can explain the status of the bid when compared to the strength in the segment. We can also see the mean, variance and distributions of the independent variables between the classes. In a decision tree, the tree will split with profit_for_customer>1 as 'Lost' class and profit_for_customer<1 as 'Won'. In logistic regression, the pseudo \\(R^2\\) will be greater for profit_for_customer than for strength_in_segment. Similar thinking can be applied to SVM, Naive-Bates classifiers etc. Mosaic Plots \u00b6 The three categorical variables are: 1. Product 2. Industry 3. Region For these variables, a mosaic plot will be useful. In the mosaic plot, the area of the rectangles is proportional to the frequency of the class. On the x-axis, we have the dependent variable, and on the y-axis, we have the independent variables. Using this, we can see the relative frequencies of the 'Won' and 'Lost' in each of the dependent variable classes. # from statsmodels.graphics.mosaicplot import mosaic mosaic ( df , [ 'product' , 'reporting_status' ]); For example, the ratio of Lost to won cases is the same in products 'G', 'Li' and 'P'. Product 'F' has more wins than normal, while product 'L' has more losses than normal. The products 'C' and 'Lo' are too small to be statistically significant. Intuitively, in logistic regression, the products 'G', 'Li' and 'P' can be considered as base classes with 'F' having a positive slope value and 'L' having a negative slope value. In decision trees, the products 'G', 'Li' and 'P' will be part of one branch while products 'L' and 'F' will be part of different branches. Similar thinking can be applied to SVM, Naive-Bates classifiers etc. Regression Visualisations \u00b6 Let us consider the regression problem. Let's say we have to predict sales_value of the successful bids. We have three categorical independent variables and four continuous independent variables. successful_bids = df [ df [ 'reporting_status' ] == 'Won' ] Scatter plots \u00b6 There are four continuous variables: 1. Strength in the segment 2. Profit for customer 3. Profit percentage 4. Joint bid portion Scatter plots show how much and how one variable is affected by another. We can use them to identify how changing the independent variable changes the dependent variable. Using this, we can identify if we have to do any transformations to the variables. plt . scatter ( successful_bids [ 'sales_value' ], successful_bids [ 'joint_bid_portion' ], color = '#86BC25' ) plt . ylabel ( 'joint_bid_portion' ) plt . xlabel ( 'sales_value' ) plt . title ( 'Scatter plot' ); In the above plot, there seems to be no relation between joint_bid_portion and sales_value. We can also observe how the joint bid portion behaves after 80. Box plots \u00b6 The three categorical variables are 1. Product 2. Industry 3. Region For these variables, a box plot will be useful. While showing the relative means among the classes, we can also visualise the variations and distributions in the data. bi_variate_boxplot = sns . boxplot ( x = \"industry\" , y = \"sales_value\" , data = successful_bids ) bi_variate_boxplot . set ( title = 'Box Chart' ); From the above plot, the mean of sales for 'Sec', 'Air, 'Ban', 'Cap', 'Con', 'Oth', 'Def', and 'Agr' are similar with similar distributions. The mean of 'Ins', 'OG', 'Gov', 'Hea', and 'Whi' classes seems to be higher and the mean of 'Mob', 'Fin', and 'Tel' is lower. In linear regression, the following industries would be considered as base classes: 'Sec', 'Air, 'Ban', 'Cap', 'Con', 'Oth', 'Def', 'Agr' while 'Ins', 'OG', 'Gov', 'Hea', 'Whi' will have positive slope ( \\(/beta\\) ) value and 'Mob', 'Fin', 'Tel' will have a negative slope. Generic EDA code \u00b6 For any dataset, we can do the following basic univariate and bivariate analysis in one go. Combining the univariate analysis \u00b6 The below function will do the following for all the columns in the dataset: 1. For continuous data, it will plot the scatter plot, box plot, histogram and q-q plot with normal distribution 2. For categorical data, it will plot the bar chart and pie chart Combining the bivariate classification analysis \u00b6 The below code will do the following for all the columns in the dataset: 1. For continuous data, it will plot the joint histograms 2. For categorical data, it will plot the mosaic plot Combining the bivariate regression analysis \u00b6 The below code will do the following for all the columns in the dataset: 1.

There are infinite ways to visualise the data, and what works is dependent on the patterns in the data. In this post, we are trying to categorise the visualisation of data for regression and classification problems. Every regression, classification and clustering problem has some or all of the following assumptions: 1. Change in independent variables changes the dependent variable. In other words, there is a relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables. Before building a model, it is advised to visualise this relationship. 2. Assumptions on the distribution of the dependent or independent variable. For example, for Naive Bayes classifier, the independent variables should follow a normal distribution. 3. Assumptions of relationships between independent variables. For example, for linear regression, the independent variables should not be correlated. 4. Unbalanced dataset. The frequency of the smaller class should be significant when compared to the frequency of the larger class. 5. The time series of data/features are stationary. Apart from validating the assumptions and identifying trends in the data, data visualisation can also be used for gathering insights and feature engineering.

We will look at some trends, patterns and effect of seasonality on the data. First, let us ponder over the popularity of Airbnb over time. The popularity is proportional to the number of reviews. Importing the reviews dataset: reviews = pd . read_csv ( 'reviews.csv.gz' , parse_dates = [ 'date' ]) reviews . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } listing_id id date reviewer_id reviewer_name comments 0 11551 30672 2010-03-21 93896 Shar-Lyn The flat was bright, comfortable and clean and... 1 11551 32236 2010-03-29 97890 Zane We stayed with Adriano and Valerio for a week ... 2 11551 41044 2010-05-09 104133 Chase Adriano was a fantastic host.

Scatter plot \u00b6 To find the number of reviews, we add the total reviews every day, and we then plot it across time as a scatter plot. fs , axs = plt . subplots ( 1 , figsize = ( 15 , 10 )) plt . title ( \"Airbnb London: Number of reviews across time\" , fontsize = 30 ) reviews . groupby ( 'date' ) . aggregate ({ 'listing_id' : 'count' }) . reset_index () . plot . scatter ( x = 'date' , y = 'listing_id' , alpha = 0.25 , ax = axs ) axs . set_ylabel ( 'Number of reviews' , fontsize = 20 ) axs . set_xlabel ( 'Time' , fontsize = 20 ) plt . show () From this plot, we can observe the following: 1. There is an exponential growth in the business pre-pandemic and this has a sudden drop after Covid related restrictions started. 2. Seasonality within every year is visible To expand n these trends, we should zoom in two sections of the plot. First we should find the seasonality and trend of the data, and then zoom into one of the pre-pandemic year to elaborate on the seasonality. Second, we can zoom into 2020-21 to identify the patterns from covid related lockdowns. # getting the total number of reviews per day reviews_time = reviews . groupby ( 'date' ) . aggregate ({ 'listing_id' : 'count' }) . reset_index () reviews_time [ 'year' ] = reviews_time . date . dt . year # Pre covid data reviews_time_proper = reviews_time [( reviews_time . year < 2020 )] We can find seasonality and trend within the pre-pandemic data by using decomposition (not explained in this blog). Splitting the data into trend, seasonal and random component, gives me the following: from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose result = seasonal_decompose ( reviews_time_proper . listing_id , model = 'additive' , period = 365 ) print ( result . plot ()) We can see an exponential trend and a repeating constant seasonality within the data.

The variation of the reviews across time and the trend before the pandemic are captured. The trend is extrapolated to 2020-21 to show the growth that could have happened if not for the pandemic. 2. Seasonality within the data is shown by semantic zooming into one sample year. We can see how Airbnb is more popular in July, September and January. 3. We can also see the effect of the pandemic on the number of reviews. We can observe a sharp decline in the first few months of 2020, and then how lockdowns and openings have affected the total number of reviews.

The others are insignificant. Similarly, Westminster and Camden are the top two locations in London. Using a sunburst chart, we can look at these two combined. listings_sunburst = listing_detailed . groupby ([ 'room_type' , 'neighbourhood_cleansed' ]) . \\ aggregate ({ 'number_of_reviews' : 'sum' }) . \\ sort_values ( 'number_of_reviews' , ascending = False ) . reset_index () fig = px . sunburst ( listings_sunburst , path = [ 'room_type' , 'neighbourhood_cleansed' ], values = 'number_of_reviews' , hover_data = [ 'room_type' , 'number_of_reviews' ], hover_name = 'neighbourhood_cleansed' , title = 'Airbnb London: Popularity sunburst chart' , width = 900 , height = 900 ) fig . show () Parallel Coordinates \u00b6 From this chart, we can see that Westminster is the most popular location for all the room types, the second and the third popular are different for different room types. Let us take Kensington and Chelsea for example, we can see the ranking of this area in every room type using a parallel coordinates plot. top_20_names = list ( listings_sunburst . sort_values ( 'number_of_reviews' , ascending = False ) . head ( 30 )[ 'neighbourhood_cleansed' ]) listings_sunburst_wide = listings_sunburst . \\ pivot ( index = 'neighbourhood_cleansed' , columns = 'room_type' , values = 'number_of_reviews' ) . reset_index () listings_sunburst_wide = listings_sunburst_wide . replace ( np . nan , 0 ) fig = px . parallel_coordinates ( listings_sunburst_wide ) # add the pink line to highlight Kensington fig . data [ 0 ][ 'dimensions' ][ 0 ][ 'constraintrange' ] = [ 50000 , 60000 ] fig . update_layout ( title_text = 'Kensington and Chelsea (in blue) popularity ranking across room types' , title_x = 0.7 , title_y = 0.05 ) fig . show () From this chart we can see how Kensington (highlighted in Blue) is in top 2 for 'Entire Home Apartment' while it's not in the top 5 for shared room. This chart, along with the sunburst above shows what type of locations are popular for different room types. Bar chart and Steam graphs \u00b6 How does this ratio between the popularities change with time? One way to see this is using a stacked bar chart. reviews_detailed = pd . merge ( listing_detailed [[ 'id' , 'neighbourhood_cleansed' , 'room_type' ]], reviews , left_on = 'id' , right_on = 'listing_id' ) fs , axs = plt . subplots ( 1 , figsize = ( 15 , 10 )) reviews_detailed [ 'year' ] = reviews_detailed . date . dt . year reviews_detailed . groupby ([ 'year' , 'room_type' ]) . \\ aggregate ({ 'listing_id' : 'count' }) . \\ unstack () . reset_index () . \\ plot . bar ( x = 'year' , y = 'listing_id' , ax = axs , stacked = True ) plt . title ( 'Popularity of different rooms across the years' , fontsize = 25 ) plt . legend ( loc = 'upper right' , title = \"Type of room\" , fontsize = 'medium' , fancybox = True ) axs . set_ylabel ( 'Number of reviews' , fontsize = 20 ) axs . set_xlabel ( 'Years' , fontsize = 20 ) plt . show () From this bar chart we can see the same increase that we have seen in the scatter plot, that is an exponential increase till 2019, and a subsequent decrease due to the pandemic. Another cool way to look at this is by looking at streamgraphs. In streamgraph, we can see the effect of seasonality within the classes. fs , ax = plt . subplots ( 1 , figsize = ( 15 , 10 )) reviews_room = reviews_detailed . groupby ([ 'date' , 'room_type' ]) . \\ aggregate ({ 'listing_id' : 'count' }) . \\ unstack () . reset_index () reviews_room . columns = [ 'date' , 'Entire home/apt' , 'Hotel room' , 'Private room' , 'Shared room' ] ax . stackplot ( reviews_room . date , list ( reviews_room [[ 'Entire home/apt' , 'Hotel room' , 'Private room' , 'Shared room' ]] . fillna ( 0 ) . \\ to_numpy () . transpose ()), baseline = 'wiggle' ) plt . title ( 'Popularity of different rooms across the years' , fontsize = 20 , y = 1.05 , loc = 'left' ) ax . text ( \"2010\" , 1050 , 'Streamgraph of the number of reviews across time' , ha = 'left' , fontsize = 12 ) plt . legend ([ 'Entire home/apt' , 'Hotel room' , 'Private room' , 'Shared room' ], loc = 'upper left' , title = \"Type of room\" ) ax . set_xlabel ( 'Years' , fontsize = 20 ) plt . show () Heatmap \u00b6 Which locations are better, and which locations should improve on their rating? We can find the average rating across the location by averaging out the rating for each host within the location. location_rating = listing_detailed . groupby ([ 'neighbourhood_cleansed' , 'room_type' ]) . \\ aggregate ({ 'review_scores_rating' : 'mean' }) . unstack () . reset_index () location_rating . columns = [ 'neighbourhood' , 'Entire home/apt' , 'Hotel room' , 'Private room' , 'Shared room' ] location_rating . index = location_rating . neighbourhood One of the ways to visualise the average rating is using a heatmap. fig , ax = plt . subplots ( figsize = [ 20 , len ( location_rating ) / 3.3 ]) sns . heatmap ( data = location_rating [[ 'Entire home/apt' , 'Hotel room' , 'Private room' , 'Shared room' ]], annot = False , cbar_kws = { \"shrink\" : 0.5 , \"orientation\" : 'vertical' }, linewidths = 0.004 , linecolor = 'grey' , vmin = 0 , vmax = 5 , center = 0.25 ) plt . show () Although this heatmap presents us the with the average ratings per borough, we can further add the following details for clarity: 1. Location of the borough in London (e.g.: Central London) 2. Arranged from the best rated to the worst rated boroughs within each location 3. Proper colour selection based on scale and human rating psychology : Average human ratings below 2.5 means bad rating and above 4.5 means very good rating (out of 5). It is more natural to use a diverging red-green scale for displaying negative-positive relationship. def add_regions ( df , borough_col_name ): \"\"\" This function takes as input a dataframe with a column which includes London's borough name Then returns the same dataframw with sub regions names added for each borough \"\"\" central = [ 'Camden' , 'City of London' , 'Kensington and Chelsea' , 'Islington' , 'Lambeth' , 'Southwark' , 'Westminster' ] east = [ 'Barking and Dagenham' , 'Bexley' , 'Greenwich' , 'Hackney' , 'Havering' , 'Lewisham' , 'Newham' , 'Redbridge' , 'Tower Hamlets' , 'Waltham Forest' ] north = [ 'Barnet' , 'Enfield' , 'Haringey' ] south = [ 'Bromley' , 'Croydon' , 'Kingston upon Thames' , 'Merton' , 'Sutton' , 'Wandsworth' ] west = [ 'Brent' , 'Ealing' , 'Hammersmith and Fulham' , 'Harrow' , 'Richmond upon Thames' , 'Hillingdon' , 'Hounslow' ] df [ 'sub_regions' ] = np . where (( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 0 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 1 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 2 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 3 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 4 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 5 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == central [ 6 ]) , 'Central' , 'no' ) df [ 'sub_regions' ] = np . where (( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 0 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 1 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 2 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 3 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 4 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 5 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 6 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 7 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 8 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == east [ 9 ]) , 'East' , df [ 'sub_regions' ]) df [ 'sub_regions' ] = np . where (( df [ borough_col_name ] == north [ 0 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == north [ 1 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == north [ 2 ]) , 'North' , df [ 'sub_regions' ]) df [ 'sub_regions' ] = np . where (( df [ borough_col_name ] == south [ 0 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == south [ 1 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == south [ 2 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == south [ 3 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == south [ 4 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == south [ 5 ]) , 'South' , df [ 'sub_regions' ]) df [ 'sub_regions' ] = np . where (( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 0 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 1 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 2 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 3 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 4 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 5 ]) | ( df [ borough_col_name ] == west [ 6 ]) , 'West' , df [ 'sub_regions' ]) return df def sort_data ( df ): \"\"\" Groups the data by location and sorts the data based on average rating within the location.

The best location in each zone is: - West: Richmond upon Thames - Central: Camden - North: Enfield - East: Hackney - South: Croydon Treemap \u00b6 In this context, it's not fair to compare ratings of different locations as we have seen that their popularities are different.

I can use a scatterplot matrix to visualise this.

The three most popular yet cheap properties are small and quaint properties near popular destinations.

We will look at some trends, patterns and effect of seasonality on the data. First, let us ponder over the popularity of Airbnb over time. The popularity is proportional to the number of reviews. Importing the reviews dataset: reviews = pd . read_csv ( 'reviews.csv.gz' , parse_dates = [ 'date' ]) reviews . head () .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type { vertical-align: middle; } .dataframe tbody tr th { vertical-align: top; } .dataframe thead th { text-align: right; } listing_id id date reviewer_id reviewer_name comments 0 11551 30672 2010-03-21 93896 Shar-Lyn The flat was bright, comfortable and clean and... 1 11551 32236 2010-03-29 97890 Zane We stayed with Adriano and Valerio for a week ... 2 11551 41044 2010-05-09 104133 Chase Adriano was a fantastic host.

There is an exponential growth in the business pre-pandemic and this has a sudden drop after Covid related restrictions started. 2. Seasonality within every year is visible To expand n these trends, we should zoom in two sections of the plot. First we should find the seasonality and trend of the data, and then zoom into one of the pre-pandemic year to elaborate on the seasonality. Second, we can zoom into 2020-21 to identify the patterns from covid related lockdowns. # getting the total number of reviews per day reviews_time = reviews . groupby ( 'date' ) . aggregate ({ 'listing_id' : 'count' }) . reset_index () reviews_time [ 'year' ] = reviews_time . date . dt . year # Pre covid data reviews_time_proper = reviews_time [( reviews_time . year < 2020 )] We can find seasonality and trend within the pre-pandemic data by using decomposition (not explained in this blog). Splitting the data into trend, seasonal and random component, gives me the following: from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose result = seasonal_decompose ( reviews_time_proper . listing_id , model = 'additive' , period = 365 ) print ( result . plot ()) We can see an exponential trend and a repeating constant seasonality within the data.

The variation of the reviews across time and the trend before the pandemic are captured. The trend is extrapolated to 2020-21 to show the growth that could have happened if not for the pandemic. 2. Seasonality within the data is shown by semantic zooming into one sample year. We can see how Airbnb is more popular in July, September and January. 3. We can also see the effect of the pandemic on the number of reviews. We can observe a sharp decline in the first few months of 2020, and then how lockdowns and openings have affected the total number of reviews.","title":"Scatter plot"},{"location":"Python/Vizualisation%20using%20python%20Part%201/#sunburst-and-pie-charts","text":"Let us now deep dive into the data and look at the type of listings and locations that have contributed to this growth.

ARIMA models are basically regression models: auto-regression simply means regression of a variable on itself measured at different time periods. AR : Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations I : Integrated. The use of differencing of raw observations (i.e. subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) in order to make the time series stationary MA : Moving Average. A model that uses the dependency between an observation and residual errors from a moving average model applied to lagged observations Stationary \u00b6 The assumption of AR model is that the time series is assumed to be a stationary process. If a time-series data, \\(Y_t\\) , is stationary, then it satisfies the following conditions: 1. The mean values of \\(Y_t\\) at different values of t are constant 2. The variances of \\(Y_t\\) at different time periods are constant (Homoscedasticity) 3. The covariances of \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-k}\\) for different lags depend only on k and not on time t Box-Jenkins method \u00b6 The initial ARMA and ARIMA models were developed by Box and Jenkins in 1970. The authors also suggested a process for identifying, estimating, and checking models for any specific time series data-set. It contains three steps Model form selection 1.1 Evaluate stationarity 1.2 Selection of the differencing level (d) \u2013 to fix stationarity problems 1.3 Selection of the AR level (p) 1.4 Selection of the MA level (q) Parameter estimation Model checking Model form selection \u00b6 Evaluate stationarity \u00b6 A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed. Time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary. A white noise series is stationary \u2014 it does not matter when you observe it, it should look much the same at any point in time. The presence of stationarity can be found in many ways among which the most popular three are: 1. ACF plot: When the data is non-stationary, the auto-correlation function will not be cut-off to zero quickly 2. Dickey\u2212Fuller or augmented Dickey\u2212Fuller tests 3. KPSS test In the below example, I will use a sample from my attendance data set described in EDA blogs. (Actual data is not shown for privacy reasons. This is mock data which is very similar to the actual one. The analysis will be the same) The time plot for the same is shown below: By looking at the plot, I can clearly see that the series is not stationary as the trend is visible and variance seems to be decreasing with time. The ACF of this time series is: From the above plot, I can identify that the time series is not stationary. Augmented Dickey\u2212Fuller Test \u00b6 Augmented Dickey\u2212Fuller test is a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are given by \\(H_0\\) : \\(\\gamma\\) = 0 (the time series is non-stationary) \\(H_1\\) : \\(\\gamma\\) < 0 (the time series is stationary) Where \\(\\Delta y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\gamma y_{t-1} + \\delta_1 \\Delta y_{t-1} + \\delta_2 \\Delta y_{t-2} + \\dots\\) ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: time.series ## Dickey-Fuller = -2.8819, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.2045 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary As p value is greater than the cut-off $ \\alpha = 5\\% $, retaining the null hypothesis that the time series is non-stationary. KPSS Test \u00b6 The null hypothesis for the KPSS test is that the data are stationary. For this test, we do NOT want to reject the null hypothesis. ## ## KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity ## ## data: time.series ## KPSS Trend = 0.41839, Truncation lag parameter = 5, p-value = 0.01 As p-value is less than 5%, rejecting the null hypothesis that the data is stationary. Selection of differencing parameter d \u00b6 The attendance data (in time) have failed both tests for the stationary, the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and the KPSS test. Differencing is used to convert the data to a stationary model. Differencing is nothing but computing the differences between consecutive observations. The above tests for first difference for in-time looks like the following: ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: time.series.diff ## Dickey-Fuller = -10.851, Lag order = 6, p-value = 0.01 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary ## ## KPSS Test for Trend Stationarity ## ## data: time.series %>% diff() ## KPSS Trend = 0.01895, Truncation lag parameter = 5, p-value = 0.1 After differencing by d = 1, The ACF of the differenced in-time looks just like that of a white noise series. In the ADF test the p-value is lower than cut-off rejecting the Null hypothesis that time series is non-stationary while the KPSS test p-value is greater than 5% retaining the null hypothesis that the data is stationary. This suggests that after differencing by one time, the in-time is essentially a random amount and is stationary. ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 1\" ## ## ####################### ## # KPSS Unit Root Test # ## ####################### ## ## Test is of type: mu with 5 lags. ## ## Value of test-statistic is: 0.0188 ## ## Critical value for a significance level of: ## 10pct 5pct 2.5pct 1pct ## critical values 0.347 0.463 0.574 0.739 Selection of AR(p) and MA(q) parameters \u00b6 One of the important tasks in using autoregressive model in forecasting is the model identification, which is, identifying the value of p and q (the number of lags). Selection of AR(p) and MA(q) lags can be done by two methods: 1. ACF and PACF functions 2. AIC or BIC coefficients ACF and PACF coefficients \u00b6 Auto-correlation is the correlation between \\(Y_t\\) measured at different time periods (for example, \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-1}\\) or \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-k}\\) ). A plot of auto-correlation for different values of k is called auto-correlation function (ACF) or correlogram. Partial auto-correlation of lag k is the correlation between \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-k}\\) when the influence of all intermediate values ( \\(Y_{t-1}\\) , \\(Y_{t-2}\\) ... \\(Y_{t-k+1}\\) ) is removed (partial out) from both \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-k}\\) . A plot of partial auto-correlation for different values of k is called partial auto-correlation function (PACF). Hypothesis tests can be carried out to check whether the auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation values are different from zero. The corresponding null and alternative hypotheses are \\(H_0: r_k = 0\\) and \\(H_A: r_k \\neq 0\\) , where \\(r_k\\) is the auto-correlation of order k \\(H_0: r_{pk} = 0\\) and \\(H_A: r_{pk} \\neq 0\\) , where \\(r_{pk}\\) is the partial auto-correlation of order k The null hypothesis is rejected when \\(|r_k| > \\frac{1 96}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) and \\(|r_{pk}| > \\frac{1 96}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) . In the ACF and PACF plots, this cut-off is shown as dotted blue lines. The values of p and q in a ARMA process can be identified using the following thumb rule: 1. Auto-correlation value, \\(r_p > cutoff\\) for first q values (first q lags) and cuts off to zero 2. Partial auto-correlation function, \\(r_{pk} > cutoff\\) for first p values and cuts off to zero After differencing, the ACF and PACF plots of in0time are as follows: From the ACF and PACF plots. The auto-correlations cuts off to zero after the first lag. The PACF value cuts off to zero after 2 lags. So, the appropriate model could be ARMA(2, 1) process. Combining differencing parameter from previous section (d=1), The most appropriate model would be ARIMA(2, 1, 1) AIC and BIC coefficients \u00b6 Akaike\u2019s Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which were useful in selecting predictors for regression, are also useful for determining the order of an ARIMA model. Best estimates of AR and MA orders will minimize AIC or BIC. ## ## Fitting models using approximations to speed things up... ## ## ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift : 2503.652 ## ARIMA(0,1,0) with drift : 2656.365 ## ARIMA(1,1,0) with drift : 2569.569 ## ARIMA(0,1,1) with drift : 2511.579 ## ARIMA(0,1,0) : 2654.343 ## ARIMA(1,1,1) with drift : 2510.969 ## ARIMA(2,1,0) with drift : 2526.337 ## ARIMA(3,1,1) with drift : 2506.575 ## ARIMA(3,1,0) with drift : 2523.835 ## ARIMA(2,1,1) : 2504.125 ## ## Now re-fitting the best model(s) without approximations... ## ## ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift : 2516.48 ## ## Best model: ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift ## Series: time.series ## ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift ## ## Coefficients: ## ar1 ar2 ma1 drift ## -0.0530 0.0200 -0.8174 -0.3120 ## s.e. 0.0811 0.0751 0.0539 0.2595 ## ## sigma^2 estimated as 574.2: log likelihood=-1253.13 ## AIC=2516.26 AICc=2516.48 BIC=2534.3 The model selected using AIC coefficient is ARIMA(2,1,1) which is same as the one selected using ACF and PACF.

Parameter estimation \u00b6 Once the model order has been identified (i.e., the values of p, d and q), we need to estimate the model parameters.

Residuals are useful in checking whether a model has adequately captured the information in the data. A good forecasting method will yield residuals with the following properties: 1. The residuals are uncorrelated. If there are correlations between residuals, then there is information left in the residuals which should be used in computing forecasts. 2. The residuals have zero mean. If the residuals have a mean other than zero, then the forecasts are biased. Portmanteau tests for auto-correlation \u00b6 When we look at the ACF plot to see whether each spike is within the required limits, we are implicitly carrying out multiple hypothesis tests, each one with a small probability of giving a false positive. When enough of these tests are done, it is likely that at least one will give a false positive, and so we may conclude that the residuals have some remaining auto-correlation, when in fact they do not. In order to overcome this problem, we test whether the first h auto-correlations are significantly different from what would be expected from a white noise process. A test for a group of auto-correlations is called a portmanteau test. One such test is the Ljung-Box test. Ljung\u2212Box Test for Auto-Correlations \u00b6 Ljung\u2212Box is a test of lack of fit of the forecasting model and checks whether the auto-correlations for the errors are different from zero. The null and alternative hypotheses are given by \\(H_0\\) : The model does not show lack of fit \\(H_1\\) : The model exhibits lack of fit The Ljung\u2212Box statistic (Q-Statistic) is given by $$ Q(m) = n(n+2) \\sum_{k=1} {m}\\frac{\\rho_k 2}{n-k} $$ where n is the number of observations in the time series, k is the number of lag, \\(r_k\\) is the auto-correlation of lag k, and m is the total number of lags. Q-statistic is an approximate chi-square distribution with m \u2013 p \u2013 q degrees of freedom where p and q are the AR and MA lags. ## ## Ljung-Box test ## ## data: Residuals from ARIMA(2,1,1) with drift ## Q* = 15.754, df = 6, p-value = 0.01513 ## ## Model df: 4.

One such method is CHAID explained in a previous blog . The most popular decision tree method is the CART or the Classification and regression trees. Decision trees partition the data set into mutually exclusive and exhaustive subsets, which results in the splitting of the original data resembling a tree-like structure. CART Classification \u00b6 We can use the CART method for regression and classification. In this blog, I will go through the CART classification in detail using the titanic example. Any decision tree model consists of 5 steps: 1. Start with the complete training data in the root node. 2. Decide on a splitting criterion 3. Split the data into two or more subsets based on the above metric 4. Using independent variables, repeat step 3 for each of the subsets of the data until --(a) All the dependent variables are exhausted, or they are not statistically significant at alpha --(b) We meet the stopping criteria 5. Generate business rules for the terminal nodes (nodes without any branches) of the tree Step 1: Start with complete data \u00b6 The data used in this blog is the same as the used in other classification posts, i.e. the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. In this problem, we have to identify what types of people had a higher chance of survival. A sample of the data is shown below. A basic EDA is performed in the blog on Logistic regression . Titanic dataset Survived Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked I 3 female 14 1 0 11.2417 C O 2 male 21 1 0 11.5000 S I 2 female 24 0 2 14.5000 S I 2 female 29 0 0 10.5000 S O 1 male 27 0 2 211.5000 C Step 2: Decide on a splitting criterion \u00b6 In CHAID bases classification, we used p-value from hypothesis tests as the splitting criterion. In CART, we will use impurity metrics like Gini Index and Entropy. Gini Index \u00b6 It is defined mathematically as: $$ Gini\\,Index = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1,i\\neq 1}^k P(C_i|t)\\times P(C_j|t)$$ where \\(P(C_i|t)\\) = Proportion of observations belonging to class \\(C_i\\) in node t. For a binary classification, \\[ Gini\\,Index = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^k P(C_i|t)^2\\] Gini Index is a measure of total variance across the classes. It has a small value if all the \\(P(C_i|t)\\) are close to zero or one. For this reason, the Gini index is a measure of node purity. A small value indicates that a node contains observations from a single class predominantly. Entropy \u00b6 An alternative to the Gini index is entropy, given by entropy: $$ Entropy = - \\sum_{i=1}^k P(C_i|t)\\times log[P(C_i|t]$$ Like the Gini index, the entropy is a small value if the node is pure. The Gini index and the entropy are quite similar numerically. For this blog, I want to consider the Gini index as my impurity measure. The aim is to minimise the Gini Index as much as possible. Step 3. Split the data into two or more subsets based on the above metric \u00b6 The Gini impurity in the base node (complete data) is ## [1] 0.472365 The impurity of the overall data is 0.47. Let us look at the purity if we split the data based on various features. Gender: \u00b6 If we split based on gender, the male and female branches individually have lower impurity (Gini index) than the base node.

To find the ideal cutoff, I have plotted the weighted gini index for split based on different ages. We can observe the minimum Gini index when the data is split at Age=7 years.

The optimal fare is 11. The impurity metrics for this split are: Fare Fare_class survived_prob proportion.of.obs child.gini.index <=11 0.2087912 0.4094488 0.3303949 >11 0.5028571 0.5905512 0.4999837 Conclusion \u00b6 Among all the factors above, Gender has the least Gini Index of 0.3338. So the initial split of the data would be on Gender. Step 4: Repeat step 3 until stopping criterion \u00b6 After splitting the data based on gender, we will get two data sets. We should perform a similar analysis to step 2 to split the data further, and so on. The splitting should stop when we meet the stopping criterion. Different stopping criterion for CART classification trees are: 1. The number of cases in the node is less than some pre-specified limit. 2. The purity of the node is more than some pre-specified threshold. 3. Depth of the node is more than some pre-specified threshold. 4. Predictor values for all records are identical In this blog, I want to give a maximum depth of trees as 3. In the machine learning blogs, I will go deeper into how to select ideal stopping criterion. For max depth=3, we get the following decision tree: Step 5: Making business rules \u00b6 From the above tree, I can see generate the following rules: 1. A female passenger has a higher probability of surviving unless she is travelling in third class with a fare less than 23. 2. A male passenger has a lower likelihood of surviving unless he is a child of age less than six years and with up to two siblings. Using this decision tree, we can observe how sociological factors like gender, age and monetary status affected the decisions on who would get into a lifeboat at a crucial time during the titanic disaster.

F-test when the response variable, Y, is continuous 3. Likelihood Ratio Test when the response variable, Y, is ordinal The steps involved in developing a CHAID tree are 1.

The variable with the least p-value, based on the statistical tests is used for splitting the dataset, thereby creating subsets.

Customer Lifetime Value is the net present value (NPV) of the future margin generated from a customer or a customer segment. Concept \u00b6 Markov Chains \u00b6 In probability theory and statistics, a sequence or other collection of random variables is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) if each random variable has the same probability distribution as the others and all are mutually independent. We have a set of states, S = { \\(s_1, s_2,...,s_r\\) }. The process starts in one of these states and moves successively from one state to another. Each move is called a step. If the chain is currently in state \\(s_i\\) , then it moves to state \\(s_j\\) at the next step with a probability denoted by \\(p_{ij}\\) , and this probability does not depend upon which states the chain was in before the current state. That is the probability to be present in state j at time t+1 is only dependent on the state at time t . $$ P_{ij} = P(X_{t+1} = j | X_{t} = i) $$ Customer Lifetime Value \u00b6 Customer lifetime value is important because, the higher the number, the greater the profits. You'll always have to spend money to acquire new customers and to retain existing ones, but the former costs five times as much. When you know your customer lifetime value, you can improve it. The customer segments can be represented as states of the Markov chain. Let {0, 1, 2, \u2026, m} be the states of a Markov chain in which states {1, 2,..., m} denote different customer segments and state 0 denotes non-customer state. The steady-state retention probability is given by $$ R_t = 1 - \\frac{\\pi_0(1-P_{00})}{1-\\pi_0}$$ Where \\(P_{00}\\) is the transition probability of State 0, and \\(\\pi_0\\) is the steady-state distribution for State 0. Similarly, Customer lifetime value for N periods is given by: \\(CLV = \\sum_{t=0}^{N} \\frac{P_I\u00d7P^t\u00d7R}{(1+i)^t}\\) Where PI is the initial distribution of customers in different states, P is the transition probability matrix, R is the reward vector (margin generated in each customer segment). The interest rate is i (discount rate), \\(d = 1 + \\frac{1}{1+i}\\) is the discount factor. Data \u00b6 The data is obtained from the UCI machine learning repository . It is an Online Retail Data Set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

You can observe that there are gaps between purchases for different customers. 'Gap' is the difference in months between two successive purchases or the difference between the current month (despite no purchase) and the last purchase month. The frequency distribution of all the purchases at different gaps is shown below: Cumulative frequency gap_month Count cumsum 0 489 51.58228 1 108 62.97468 2 50 68.24895 3 33 71.72996 4 20 73.83966 5 30 77.00422 6 18 78.90295 7 18 80.80169 8 21 83.01688 9 6 83.64979 10 20 85.75949 11 38 89.76793 12 97 100.00000 From the above distribution, I am assuming that a customer who has not transacted for greater than 6 months is inactive.

According to Markov, the probability of a customer to move to state j at any step is only given by the previous state i . $$ P_{ij} = P(X_{t+1} = j | X_{t} = i) $$ For each interaction (Class1 to Class 2, month 2 to month 3, Step 3 to step 4), a transaction matrix can be created which has the probability of moving from i the state to j state. But before I can create the one-step transition probabilities, I need to check whether the sequence of random variables can be approximated to a Markov chain. This is carried out using Anderson\u2212Goodman test which is a chi-square test of independence.

You can observe that there are gaps between purchases for different customers. 'Gap' is the difference in months between two successive purchases or the difference between the current month (despite no purchase) and the last purchase month. The frequency distribution of all the purchases at different gaps is shown below: Cumulative frequency gap_month Count cumsum 0 489 51.58228 1 108 62.97468 2 50 68.24895 3 33 71.72996 4 20 73.83966 5 30 77.00422 6 18 78.90295 7 18 80.80169 8 21 83.01688 9 6 83.64979 10 20 85.75949 11 38 89.76793 12 97 100.00000 From the above distribution, I am assuming that a customer who has not transacted for greater than 6 months is inactive.","title":"Data"},{"location":"R/CustomerLifetimeValue/#creating-a-markov-chain","text":"Loading the libraries required in this section At 2011-06-01, the state of a customer is given by: elapsed_months <- function ( end_date , start_date ) { ed <- as.POSIXlt ( end_date ) sd <- as.POSIXlt ( start_date ) 12 * ( ed $ year - sd $ year ) + ( ed $ mon - sd $ mon ) } final_classes <- filtered_data %>% filter ( InvoiceDate < date ( '2011-07-01' )) %>% group_by ( CustomerID ) %>% summarise ( recent_purchase_date = max ( InvoiceDate )) %>% mutate ( Class1 = elapsed_months ( date ( '2011-07-01' ), date ( recent_purchase_date ))) %>% mutate ( Class1 = as.integer ( Class1 )) kable ( final_classes %>% sample_n ( 10 ), align = 'c' , caption = 'Initial state' ) %>% kable_styling ( full_width = F ) Initial state CustomerID recent_purchase_date Class1 17450 2011-06-21 16:01:00 1 14896 2011-05-19 10:20:00 2 18061 2011-06-10 14:46:00 1 13065 2010-12-01 16:52:00 7 17231 2011-06-02 19:50:00 1 15894 2011-03-31 13:50:00 4 14729 2010-12-01 12:43:00 7 15965 2010-12-07 13:18:00 7 15834 2011-06-27 10:16:00 1 16081 2011-06-07 13:31:00 1 Here the states are defined as: State Recency Level Explanation 1 1 Last purchase made this month 2 2 Last purchase made last month 3 3 Last purchase made 2 months ago 4 4 Last purchase made 3 months ago 5 5 Last purchase made 4 months ago 6 6 Last purchase made 5 months ago 7 7-12 Purchase made 6 months or before (Churn state) Similarly, the state of the customer at the start of each month is: States after every month CustomerID recent_purchase_date Class1 Class2 Class3 Class4 Class5 Class6 13831 2011-05-23 13:25:00 2 1 2 1 2 1 12779 2011-06-03 10:37:00 1 2 3 4 5 1 17519 2011-06-19 13:55:00 1 1 2 3 4 1 12434 2011-04-04 09:57:00 3 4 5 1 2 3 13021 2011-06-26 11:53:00 1 1 2 1 2 1 17860 2010-12-06 12:41:00 7 7 7 7 7 7 12585 2011-04-19 13:39:00 3 4 5 6 7 7 16995 2010-12-02 17:09:00 7 7 7 7 7 7 14911 2011-06-30 15:46:00 1 1 1 1 1 1 15350 2010-12-01 13:33:00 7 7 7 7 7 7 I can observe that every customer moves from one class (state) to another state every month (step). According to Markov, the probability of a customer to move to state j at any step is only given by the previous state i . $$ P_{ij} = P(X_{t+1} = j | X_{t} = i) $$ For each interaction (Class1 to Class 2, month 2 to month 3, Step 3 to step 4), a transaction matrix can be created which has the probability of moving from i the state to j state. But before I can create the one-step transition probabilities, I need to check whether the sequence of random variables can be approximated to a Markov chain. This is carried out using Anderson\u2212Goodman test which is a chi-square test of independence. The null and alternative hypotheses to check whether the sequence of random variables follows a Markov chain is stated below: \\(H_0\\) : The sequences of transitions ( \\(X_1, X_2, \u2026, X_n\\) ) are independent (zero-order Markov chain) \\(H_A\\) : The sequences of transitions ( \\(X_1, X_2, \u2026, X_n\\) ) are dependent (first-order Markov chain) The corresponding test statistic is $$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} (\\frac{(O_{ij} -E_{ij})^2}{E_{jj}}) $$ The transition probability matrix for the transition form State 1 to 2 is: seq_matr <- markovchainFit ( final_classes [ 3 : 4 ], method = \"mle\" , name = 'CLV' ) seq_matr $ estimate ## CLV ## A 7 - dimensional discrete Markov Chain defined by the following states: ## 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ## The transition matrix (by rows) is defined as follows: ## 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ## 1 0.57777778 0.4222222 0.0000000 0.00 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## 2 0.42957746 0.0000000 0.5704225 0.00 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## 3 0.32000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.68 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## 4 0.13461538 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.00 0.8653846 0.0000000 0.0000000 ## 5 0.18181818 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.00 0.0000000 0.8181818 0.0000000 ## 6 0.08333333 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.00 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.9166667 ## 7 0.10800000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.00 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.8920000 From the above matrix, P(4,5) = 0.8684211 means that the probability of moving from State 4 to State 5 is 86%.

I can do a likelihood ratio test to test the homogeneity of transition matrices. That means I want to find out if the changes in TP across time are random, and I can take a constant TP to describe the different TP's or not. The Null and alternative hypothesis is: \\(H_0 : P_{ij} (t) = P_{ij}\\) \\(H_1 : P_{ij} (t) \\neq P_{ij}\\) The test statistic for a likelihood ratio test (Chi-square test) is given by $$ \\chi^2 = \\sum_{t} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{j} \\frac{n(t)[\\hat P_{ij}(t)-\\hat P_{ij}]^2}{\\hat P_{ij}} $$ where n(t) is the number of customers in state i at time t.

This is done usually for the following reasons: 1. Find interrelationships among different kinds of variables 2. Identify common underlying dimension 3. Data reduction and removing duplicate columns Among the many types of ways one can do factor analysis, two ways are popular. They are 1. Principal component analysis 2. Common factor analysis PCA considers the total variance in the data while CFA only considers the common variance. In this blog, we are going to discuss Principal component analysis. Principal component analysis \u00b6 PCA is the most widely used exploratory factor analysis technique, It is developed by Pearson and Hotelling. The objective of PCA is to rigidly rotate the axes of p-dimensional space to new positions (principal axes) that have the following properties: 1. Ordered such that principal axis 1 has the highest variance, axis 2 has the next highest variance, ...., and axis p has the lowest variance 2. Covariance among each pair of the principal axes is zero (the principal axes are uncorrelated) Data and problem \u00b6 This dataset contains 90 responses for 14 different variables that customers consider while purchasing car. The survey questions were framed using 5-point likert scale with 1 being very low and 5 being very high. The data can be downloaded from this link . The variables were the following: 1. Price 2. Safety 3. Exterior looks 4. Space and comfort 5. Technology 6. After sales service 7. Resale value 8. Fuel type 9. Fuel efficiency 10. Colour 11. Maintenance 12. Test drive 13. Product reviews 14.

High values (between 0.5 and 1.0) indicate factor analysis is appropriate. Values below 0.5 imply that factor analysis may not be appropriate ## Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin factor adequacy ## Call: KMO(r = efa) ## Overall MSA = 0.61 ## MSA for each item = ## Price Safety Exterior_Looks Space_comfort ## 0.72 0.47 0.55 0.61 ## Technology After_Sales_Service Resale_Value Fuel_Type ## 0.65 0.62 0.63 0.68 ## Fuel_Efficiency Color Maintenance Test_drive ## 0.62 0.56 0.61 0.64 ## Product_reviews Testimonials ## 0.69 0.50 As some variables have KMO close to and less than 5, more data should be captured for the variables for doing factor analysis. As this is just an example, we will continue to use the same data for analysis. Bartlett's test of sphericity \u00b6 Bartlett's test of sphericity is a test statistic used to examine the hypothesis that the variables are uncorrelated in the population. In other words, the population correlation matrix is an identity matrix; each variable correlates perfectly with itself (r = 1) but has no correlation with the other variables (r = 0). \\(H_0\\) : All non-diagonal values of correlation matrix are zero \\(H_1\\) : Not all diagonal values of correlation matrix are zero ## ## Bartlett's test of sphericity ## ## data: efa ## X-squared = 247.71, df = 91, p-value < 2.2e-16 From the above correlation matrix and the test we can observe that there is some dependence between the variables and factor analysis can therefore be performed. In this example, the factors can be considered as the underlying thought process while each variable can be considered as the response to the question. While looking for comfort in a car, a person might look into aesthetics, functionality, economic value and credibility. These are factors while the survey questions are variables. While replying to a question in a survey, for every variable, the respondent underlying thought process gives weightage to each factor as a function of that variable. This can be written as (for normalized variables): $$ y_1 = \\lambda_{11} f_1 + \\lambda_{12} f_2 + \\cdots + \\lambda_{1m} f_m + \\epsilon_1 $$ $$ y_2 = \\lambda_{21} f_1 + \\lambda_{22} f_2 + \\cdots + \\lambda_{2m} f_m + \\epsilon_2 $$ $$ ... $$ $$ y_p = \\lambda_{p1} f_1 + \\lambda_{p2} f_2 + \\cdots + \\lambda_{pm} f_m + \\epsilon_p $$ Where \\(f_1, f_2 \\cdots\\) are the factors and \\(y_1, y_2 \\cdots\\) are variables. \\(\\lambda_{pm}\\) are called factor loadings, or the correlation between variables and factors. Number of factors \u00b6 The number of factors to decompose the dataset should be selected. There are multiple ways of doing it, the most popular ones are: 1. Number of eigenvalues greater than 1 2. Scree plot 3, Percentage of variation explained Let us look at each one of them: Eigen values \u00b6 The eigenvalue represents the total variance explained by each factor. If each variable is normalized before the analysis, the maximum eigen value of all the factors combined should be equal to the number of variables (As normalized variables have variation as 1) The eigen values(from the co-variance matrix) for this data set is: ## [1] 2.1585694 1.6836760 1.0709449 0.9760982 0.7723481 0.6364842 0.5211956 ## [8] 0.4245587 0.3942269 0.3600300 0.2747809 0.2306904 0.1774646 0.1588822 Any factor which has eigen value less than 1 explains the variation less than the variation explained by a variable. So one way to identify the number of factors is the number of eigenvalues greater than 1. From the eigen values, the number of factors to consider is 3. Scree plot \u00b6 A scree plot is a line plot of the eigenvalues of factors or principal components in an analysis. A scree plot always displays the eigenvalues in a downward curve, ordering the eigenvalues from largest to smallest. According to the scree test, the \"elbow\" of the graph where the eigenvalues seem to level off is found and factors or components to the left of this point should be retained as significant. It is named after its resemblance to scree(broken rock fragments at the base of cliffs) after its elbow. ## Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = 4 and the number of components = NA From the scree plot, a significant slope change can be observed after the third or fourth factor. The number of factors to consider from scree plot is 3. After identifying the number of factors, the next step in PCA is to create the factors without rotation. This is done in such a way to satisfy: 1. Principal axis-1 has the highest variance, axis-2 has the next highest variance, .... , and axis p has the lowest variance 2. Co-variance among each pair of the principal axes is zero (the principal axes are uncorrelated) ## ## Call: ## factanal(x = ~., factors = 3, data = efa, na.action = na.exclude, rotation = \"none\", cutoff = 0.3) ## ## Uniquenesses: ## Price Safety Exterior_Looks Space_comfort ## 0.721 0.896 0.849 0.277 ## Technology After_Sales_Service Resale_Value Fuel_Type ## 0.870 0.758 0.306 0.713 ## Fuel_Efficiency Color Maintenance Test_drive ## 0.592 0.258 0.567 0.904 ## Product_reviews Testimonials ## 0.782 0.854 ## ## Loadings: ## Factor1 Factor2 Factor3 ## Price 0.353 0.199 0.339 ## Safety -0.233 0.200 ## Exterior_Looks -0.281 0.127 0.238 ## Space_comfort -0.235 0.815 ## Technology 0.358 ## After_Sales_Service 0.149 0.466 ## Resale_Value 0.618 -0.116 0.547 ## Fuel_Type 0.524 ## Fuel_Efficiency 0.538 0.341 ## Color 0.678 -0.526 ## Maintenance 0.608 0.208 0.141 ## Test_drive 0.112 0.286 ## Product_reviews 0.296 0.361 ## Testimonials 0.208 -0.318 ## ## Factor1 Factor2 Factor3 ## SS loadings 1.945 1.813 0.897 ## Proportion Var 0.139 0.130 0.064 ## Cumulative Var 0.139 0.268 0.333 ## ## Test of the hypothesis that 3 factors are sufficient. ## The chi square statistic is 65.94 on 52 degrees of freedom. ## The p-value is 0.0925 The sum of square loading (SS Loadings) represents the eigen values of each loading. The uniqueness of each variable is also shown. \\(Uniqueness=1\u2212Communality\\) where Communality is the SS of all the factor loadings for a given variable. If all the factors jointly explain a large percent of variance in a given variable, that variable has high Communality (and thus low uniqueness). Our goal is to name the factors. Sometimes visualizations help. Plotting the factor loadings for the first two factors. It can be difficult to label factors when they are unrotated, since a description of one factor might overlap with a description of another factor. We can rotate the factors to obtain more straightforward interpretations. Rotations are of various types: 1. Varimax rotation: An orthogonal rotation method that minimizes the number of variables that have high loadings on each factor. This method simplifies the interpretation of the factors 2. Quartimax rotation: A rotation method that minimizes the number of factors needed to explain each variable. This method simplifies the interpretation of the observed variables 3. Equamax rotation: A rotation method that is a combination of the varimax method, which simplifies the factors, and the quartimax method which simplifies the variables 4. Direct Oblimin Method: A method for oblique (non-orthogonal) rotation 5. Promax rotation: An oblique rotation, which allows factors to be correlated The loadings for oblimin method is shown: ## ## Loadings: ## MR1 MR2 MR3 ## Fuel_Efficiency 0.682 ## Maintenance 0.591 -0.315 ## Product_reviews 0.496 ## After_Sales_Service 0.444 ## Price 0.417 ## Color 0.377 ## Test_drive 0.308 ## Space_comfort 0.381 0.725 ## Resale_Value 0.402 -0.520 ## Fuel_Type 0.413 ## Safety 0.317 ## Technology ## Exterior_Looks ## Testimonials 0.306 0.664 ## ## MR1 MR2 MR3 ## SS loadings 2.136 1.595 0.873 ## Proportion Var 0.153 0.114 0.062 ## Cumulative Var 0.153 0.267 0.329 In this example, for any rotation, when we consider three factors, one variable is becoming insignificant and is not loading to any factor.

Class imbalance happens when the dependant variable has one class with a higher frequency compared to the lower class. Take an example of the below data. In this data, the class in blue is the minority class with a class imbalance of 10/40 = 25%. Such behaviour is observed in various problems such as: 1. Fraud detection 2. Conversion prediction 3. Spam detection 4. Churn prediction 5. Outlier detection Each of these problem statements is binary class problems with the minority class having a significantly lower frequency than the majority class. Despite this, the prediction of the minority class is more important. Why is this a problem? \u00b6 From the above data, we could create a model which predicts the class always as Red . This model will have an accuracy of 75%. If this were fraud detection, for example, then this prediction would be worthless as we would not be predicting any fraud. In the above example, it is easy to split the data accurately into two classes, i.e. those above 10 are red class and the remaining are blue. This can be done as this data is linearly separable. However, in most cases, if we are using accuracy or AUC for prediction, then we would reach the model that always predicts Red. This can be sometimes resolved by changing the optimising metric to use while training, like sensitivity or specificity, which will be described in another blog. In any case, it is good to balance the classes before training a machine learning model. How to resolve this issue? \u00b6 Balancing the classes means reducing the imbalance in the data set. This can be achieved in many ways, but three are discussed in this blog. They are: 1. Up-sampling 2. Down-sampling 3. SMOTE sampling Upsampling \u00b6 In up-sampling, we randomly sample (with replacement) the minority class to be the same size as the majority class. While this retains the full information of both the classes, the size of the data will become much larger. This can cause data handling and speed issues. Downsampling \u00b6 In down-sampling, we subset the majority class in such a way that their frequency is similar to the minority class. This will create a smaller data-set which is easier to train, but the information from the majority class can be lost. SMOTE Sampling \u00b6 SMOTE is a technique which down-sample the majority class and synthesises new data points in the minority class. SMOTE stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique.

It is the example problem at page 52, chapter 2,5. In this blog I will try to understand how to solve simple linear programming problems using R. Problem M&D Chemicals produces two products that are sold as raw materials to companies manufacturing bath soaps and laundry detergents. Based on an analysis of current inventory levels and potential demand for the coming month, M&D's management specified that the combined production for products A and B must total at least 350 gallons. Separately, a major customer's order for 125 gallons of product A must also be satisfied. Product 'A' requires 2 hours of processing time per gallon and product B requires 1 hour of processing time per gallon. For the coming month, 600 hours of processing time are available. M&D's objective is to satisfy these requirements at a minimum total production cost. Production costs are 2 dollars per gallon for product A and 3 dollars per gallon for product B. Suppose additionally there is a constraint that the maximum production for B is 400 gallons. Solution The decision variables and objective function for the problem is as follows: \\(x_A\\) = number of gallons of product A \\(x_B\\) = number of gallons of product B With production costs at 2 dollars per gallon for product A and 3 dollars per gallon for product B, the objective function that corresponds to the minimization of the total production cost can be written as $$ Min( 2x_A + 3x_B) $$ The different constraints for the problem will be as follows: 1. To satisfy the major customer's demand for 125 gallons of product A, we know A must be at least 125. $$ x_A \\geq 125 $$ 2. The combined production for both products must total at least 350 gallons $$ x_A + x_B \\geq 350 $$ 3. The available processing time must not exceed 600 hours $$ 2x_A+x_B \\leq 600 $$ 4. The production of B cannot exceed 400 gallons $$ x_b \\leq 400 $$ 5. As the production of A or B cannot be negative. $$ x_A \\geq 0, x_B \\geq 0 $$ Formulation \u00b6 Combining all the constraints, the LP can be written as: $$ Min(2x_A + 3x_B) $$ Subject to constraints: A B RHS 1 0 \\(\\geq\\) 125 1 1 \\(\\geq\\) 350 2 1 \\(\\leq\\) 600 0 1 \\(\\leq\\) 400 Graphical solution \u00b6 Plotting the constraints I get the shaded region as the intersection region which satisfies all the constraints. Solutions that satisfy all the constraints are termed feasible solutions, and the shaded region is called the feasible solution region, or simply the feasible region. From the above plot, I observe that \\(x_b < 400\\) is a redundant constraint. To find the minimum-cost solution, we now draw the objective function line corresponding to a particular total cost value. For example, we might start by drawing the line \\(2x_A + 3x_B = 1200\\) . This line is shown in below simulation. Clearly, some points in the feasible region would provide a total cost of $1200. To find the values of A and B that provide smaller total cost values, we move the objective function line in a lower left direction until, if we moved it any farther, it would be entirely outside the feasible region. Note that the objective function line \\(2x_A + 3x_B = 800\\) intersects the feasible region at the extreme point \\(x_A = 250\\) and \\(x_B = 100\\) . This extreme point provides the minimum-cost solution with an objective function value of 800. Therefore the ideal production to minimize cost should be to produce 250 gallons of A and 100 gallons of B. Solution in R \u00b6 In R, LP_solve is implemented through the lpSolve and lpSolveAPI packages. Using the lpSolve package, I can solve a linear programming problem as follows: library ( lpSolve ) # A matrix of LHS of constraints (except the non negative) constraints.LHS <- matrix ( c ( 1 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 1 , 0 , 1 ), nrow = 4 , byrow = TRUE ) # A list of RHS of constraints (except the non negative) RHS <- c ( 125 , 350 , 600 , 400 ) # A list of the constraints directions (except the non negative) constranints_direction <- c ( \">=\" , \">=\" , \"<=\" , '<=' ) # A list of objective function coefficients objective.fxn <- c ( 2 , 3 ) # Find the optimal solution optimum <- lp ( direction = \"min\" , objective.in = objective.fxn , const.mat = constraints.LHS , const.dir = constranints_direction , const.rhs = RHS , all.int = T , compute.sens = TRUE ) The result of the above (after formatting) is: ## Success: the objective function is 800 Variables Variable Optimum.Value Reduced.Cost Objective.coefficient Allowable.decrease Allowable.Increase A 250 0 2 -1e+30 3 B 100 0 3 2 1e+30 Constraints Constraint Dual.Value Slack.Surplus RHS.Value Allowable.Decrease.to Allowable.Increase.to 1 0 125 125 -1e+30 1e+30 2 4 0 350 300 475 3 -1 0 600 475 700 4 0 -300 400 -1e+30 1e+30 5 0 250 0 -1e+30 1e+30 6 0 100 0 -1e+30 1e+30 Sensitivity analysis \u00b6 Sensitivity analysis is the study of how the changes in the coefficients of an optimization model affect the optimal solution. Using sensitivity analysis, we can answer questions such as the following: 1. How will a change in a coefficient of the objective function affect the optimal solution? 2. How will a change in the right-hand-side value for a constraint affect the optimal solution? From the above solution, I observe the following 1. The current price coefficient of A is 2 and the current price coefficient of B is 3. The optimal solution will remain the same even if the price of A is 3 keeping the price of B constant, or if the price of B is 2 keeping A constant. This can be visualized above. 2. The binding constraints ie: processing time and production of both products have a Slack/Surplus values of zero. The other non binding constraints have positive/negative slack values. Slack values represent the unused capacity. 3. The dual value associated with a constraint is the change in the optimal value of the solution per unit increase in the right-hand side of the constraint. For example, if I increased the minimum production constraint from 350 to 351, The cost of production will increase by 4 dollars. Similarly if I could increase the available processing time to 601 hours instead of 600 hours, the cost will decrease by 1 dollar. The range in which this increase or decrease is applicable is also given. This can be visualized in the above simulation.","title":"Linear Programming (R)"},{"location":"R/Linear-programming/#simple-minimization-problem","text":"This Problem is taken from An Introduction to Management Science : Quantitative Approach to Decision Making book.

For example, a regression goal is predicting housing prices in an area. In this blog post, I will attempt to solve a supervised regression problem using the famous Boston housing price data set. Other than location and square footage, a house value is determined by various other factors. The data used in this blog is taken from Kaggle . It originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. The data frame contains the following columns: crim : per capita crime rate by town. zn : proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. indus : proportion of non-retail business acres per town. chas : Charles River categorical variable (tract bounds or otherwise). nox : nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million). rm : average number of rooms per dwelling. age : proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940. dis : weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres. rad : index of accessibility to radial highways. tax : full-value property-tax rate per $10,000. ptratio : pupil-teacher ratio by town. black : racial discrimination factor. lstat : lower status of the population (percent) The target variable is medv : median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. In particular, in this blog I want to use multiple linear regression for the analysis.

Uni-variate analysis \u00b6 Now, I want to do some basic EDA on each column. On each continuous column, I want to visually check the following: 1. Variation in the column 2. Its distribution 3. Any outliers 4. q-q plot with normal distribution ## [1] \"Univariate plots for crim\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for zn\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for indus\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for nox\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for rm\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for age\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for dis\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for rad\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for tax\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for ptratio\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for black\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for lstat\" ## [1] \"Univariate plots for medv\" For categorical variables, I want to look at the frequencies. Observations: 1. If I look at rad and tax , I observe that there seem to be two categories. Houses having rad < 10 follow a normal distribution, and there are some houses with rad = 24. As rad is an index, it could also be thought of as a categorical variable instead of a continuous variable. 2. For data points with rad = 25, the behaviour in location based features looks different. For example indus , tax and ptratio have a different slope at the same points where the rad is 24. (observation for variation plots(top left plots)) Therefore, I am tempted to group the houses which have rad = 24 into one category, and create interaction variables of that column with rad , indus , ptratio and tax . The new variable is called rad_cat . Also, I would like to convert rad itself to categorical and see if it can explain better than continuous variable. Additionally, from researching on the internet, I found that the cost might have a different slope with the number of bedrooms for different class of people. So, I want to visualize that interaction variable also. Bi variate analysis \u00b6 I want to understand the relationship of each continuous variable with the \\(y\\) variable. I will achieve that by doing the following: 1. A scatter plot to look at the relationship between the \\(x\\) and the \\(y\\) variables. 2. Draw a linear regression line and a smoothed means line to understand the curve fit. 3. Predict using Linear regression using the variable alone to observe the increase in R-squared. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -15.816 -5.455 -1.970 2.633 29.615 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

From the box plot I can observe that the class 'rad24' is different from all the other classes. That is what is being shown in the regression equation. If 'rad1' was my base class, then all other classes are similar except for 'rad24' which is significantly different from base class. This validates my initial creation of interaction variables with rad_cat too. 2. There seems to be significant difference between the houses that are Charles River track-bound or otherwise. Correlation \u00b6 The correlation between different variables is as follows Observations: 1. There is a lot of correlation between many location based features like dis and nox , dist and indus , dist and age , rm and lstat , lstat and indus etc. The correlations between different (continuous) variables can be visualized below. Initial Model Training \u00b6 For my initial model, I am training using step wise linear regression. In every step, I want to observe the following: 1. What variables are added or removed from the model. The current model pics the column which gives the greatest decrease in AIC. The model stops when the decrease in AIC w.r.t. null(no change) is lower than the threshold. 2.

Initially all the factors were considered in the model. 2. By removing age from the initial model, the AIC is 1295.5 vs 1297.43 in the initial model. Therefore, age was removed. 3. By removing industry from the initial model, the AIC is 1293.6 vs the AIC of 1297.43. Therefore, industry was removed. 4. Adding or removing any other variable does not decrease AIC significantly. The remaining factors are the best factors of the final model. Observations: 1. For every unit increase in crime, the price decreases by 0.12 units. 2. For every large residential properties, the price increases by 0.0421 units. 3. For every unit increase in NOX(pollution) levels, the price decreases by -17.25 units. 4. The presence of Charles River in track bounds increases the price of the property by 2.03 units. 5. One extra room increases the price by 4.12 6. Increase in average distance from work centres by 1 unit decreases the price by 1.47 units. 7. Increase in tax by one unit decreases the price by -0.01 units. 8. Surprisingly, increasing the parent teacher ratio by one unit, decreases the price by 0.96 units. 9. Racial discrimination is still an important factor. 10. One unit increase of lower status of the population decreases the price by 0.52 units. 11. The presence of 'rad=24' increases the price by 5.6 units. Model diagnostics \u00b6 I want to look at R-Squared and adjusted R-Square of the model on the test data. R-Square explains the proportion of variation in \\(y\\) explained by our dependent variables. Then I want to look at the statistical significance of individual variables (using t-test) and validation of complete model (using F test). Some basic assumptions for doing the tests are validated using residual analysis, and finally I will look into multi-collinearity. The R-Squared and RMSE of the model on test data are: \u00b6 ## RMSE Rsquared MAE ## 4.5506048 0.6797879 3.2017260 R-Square remains similar on the test set. Therefore, we are not over-fitting. Testing statistical significance of individual dependent variables \u00b6 The Null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis for each of the dependent variables \\(i\\) is: $$ H_0 : \\beta_i= 0 $$ $$ H_1 : \\beta_i \\neq 0 $$ The statistical significance can be validated using a t-test. Validating the complete model \u00b6 The null and alternate hypothesis for the model \\(y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2+...+\\beta_kx_k + \\epsilon\\) is: $$ H_0 : \\beta_1 = \\beta_2 = ... = \\beta_k = 0 $$ $$ H_1 : Not \\, all\\, \\beta_i \\,are\\, 0 $$ The statistical significance can be validated using F test. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ crim + zn + chasTract_bounds + nox + ## rm + dis + tax + ptratio + black + lstat + rad_catloc24, ## data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -16.1877 -2.7794 -0.5639 1.8186 26.2200 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Also, the F-Statistic is 106.2 with a p value <2.2e-16. Thus, I reject both the above null hypothesis. The model is statistically significant. Residual analysis \u00b6 Some assumptions in the above hypothesis tests are: 1. The mean of errors should be zero 2. The variance of the errors should be constant across \\(y\\) 3.

They should follow a random distribution I can validate these three assumptions using the residual plots ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ crim + zn + chasTract_bounds + nox + ## rm + dis + tax + ptratio + black + lstat + rad_catloc24, ## data = dat) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) crim zn chasTract_bounds ## 35.63847 -0.12514 0.04218 2.03047 ## nox rm dis tax ## -17.25517 4.12029 -1.47673 -0.01007 ## ptratio black lstat rad_catloc24 ## -0.96129 0.00880 -0.52637 5.66908 ## ## ## ASSESSMENT OF THE LINEAR MODEL ASSUMPTIONS ## USING THE GLOBAL TEST ON 4 DEGREES-OF-FREEDOM: ## Level of Significance = 0.05 ## ## Call: ## gvlma(x = model$finalModel) ## ## Value p-value Decision ## Global Stat 650.35 0.000e+00 Assumptions NOT satisfied! ## Skewness 125.66 0.000e+00 Assumptions NOT satisfied! ## Kurtosis 385.33 0.000e+00 Assumptions NOT satisfied! ## Link Function 120.98 0.000e+00 Assumptions NOT satisfied! ## Heteroscedasticity 18.39 1.803e-05 Assumptions NOT satisfied! Observations: None of the three conditions are properly satisfied. Certain outlier points seem to have a huge effect on the residuals and the model. As normality conditions are not met, I cannot trust the p values from above t and F statistics. Multi-collinearity \u00b6 From the correlation matrix, I am expecting large multicollinearity between the features. Variation inflation factor is the value by which the square of the estimate is inflated in presence of multi-collinearity. The t-statistic is thus deflated by \\(\\sqrt(VIF)\\) and standard error of estimate is inflated by \\(\\sqrt(VIF)\\) . $$ VIF = \\frac{1}{1-(R_j)^2} $$ Where \\(R_j\\) is the regression correlation coefficient between \\(j\\) th variable and all other dependent variables. A VIF of greater than 10 is considered bad. (decreases the t-value ~3.16 times, thus increasing p-value) ## crim zn chasTract_bounds nox ## 1.733555 2.394835 1.050701 3.810818 ## rm dis tax ptratio ## 1.825246 3.581245 7.671215 1.855131 ## black lstat rad_catloc24 ## 1.320648 2.551655 7.602218 The t-value for tax and rad_cat variables are inflated by \\(\\sqrt(VIF) = \\sqrt(7.6) =2.7\\) . The corrected t-value would be $$ t_{actual} = \\frac{\\beta_i}{S_e(\\beta_i)} * \\sqrt(VIF) = t_{pred} \\sqrt(VIF$$ Where t-predicted is the value of t in the summary table. Increasing t-value by ~2.7% decreases p further, and as both the values *tax and rad_cat have p-values below 5%, increasing the t-value further will only decrease the p-value further making the two variables more significant. Testing over-fitting \u00b6 To prevent over fitting, it is important to find the ideal number of independent variables. Mallows's \\(C_p\\) is used to identify the ideal number of features in the model. The best regression model is the model with the number of parameters close to \\(C_p\\) . $$ C_p = \\frac{SSE_p}{MSE_{full}} -(N-2p) $$ Where N is the number of observations and p is the number of parameters. The Mallows cp in our case is: ## [1] 10.18672 The number of features that are significant in the current model is 11. Auto correlation \u00b6 Durbin watson is a hypothesis test to test the existence of auto correlation. The null and alternate hypothesis are: $$ H_0 : \\rho_i= 0 $$ $$ H_1 : \\rho_i \\neq 0 $$ The test statistic is the Durbin Watson statistic \\(D\\) . D is between 0 and 4. D close to 2 implies absence of auto correlation. ## lag Autocorrelation D-W Statistic p-value ## 1 0.4198705 1.144239 0 ## Alternative hypothesis: rho != 0 As p value is less than cut-off at \\(\\alpha =0.05\\) , there is no auto correlation. Auto correlation generally exists in time series data. Outlier analysis \u00b6 From the residual plots, I suspect that that there might be certain outliers that are adversely effecting the model. I am using the following distance measures to check for outliers in the model. 1. Mahalanobis distance: Distance between the observation and the centroid of the values 2. Leverages: Capacity of an observation to be influential due to having extreme predictor values (unusual combination of predictor values). 3. Jackknife residuals (studentized residual): Division of residuals by its standard deviation 4. Cook's distance': Detects observations that have a disproportionate impact on the determination of the model parameters (large change in parameters if deleted). 5. DFBETAS: Changes in coefficients when the observations are deleted. 6. DFFITS: Change in the fitted value when the observation is deleted (standardized by the standard error) 7. hat: Diagonal elements of the hat matrix 8. cov.r: Co-variance ratios The above metrics for sample 5 observations, and outlier plots (for significant metrics) are as follows: Outlier metrics dfb.1_ dfb.crim dfb.zn dfb.chT_ dfb.nox dfb.rm dfb.dis dfb.tax dfb.ptrt dfb.blck dfb.lstt dfb.r_24 dffit cov.r cook.d hat maha X369 0.7796401 -0.2317501 0.1678140 -0.0579735 -0.0936772 -1.1097413 -0.4805830 -0.0144256 -0.0745656 0.0747545 -1.1868934 0.4152958 1.5508236 0.4063263 0.1848802 0.0656965 59.32389 X419 0.0147891 0.3645414 -0.0178977 0.0107611 0.0119382 -0.0058155 0.0304393 0.0005552 0.0161723 -0.1159999 -0.0610864 -0.0882379 0.4029018 1.2799527 0.0135408 0.2094680 80.63853 X411 0.0050986 0.0114598 -0.0002544 0.0003139 -0.0021656 -0.0040736 -0.0019297 0.0004132 0.0001400 -0.0077489 -0.0068897 -0.0021726 0.0159856 1.1901705 0.0000213 0.1338773 55.40362 X406 0.0201748 -0.2245737 0.0051880 -0.0027568 -0.0129879 -0.0007893 -0.0145494 -0.0025818 -0.0039595 -0.0563659 0.0126108 0.0401276 -0.2356062 1.2262623 0.0046343 0.1664139 65.24982 X381 0.0980385 -0.5245638 0.0341992 -0.0047776 -0.0327019 -0.0832358 -0.0461418 -0.0290283 -0.0292670 -0.1138749 0.0386572 0.1235709 -0.5425691 1.4946534 0.0245556 0.3231086 126.23671 Cooks distance and leverage values plots: Building a better model \u00b6 Now that I know all the problems that are present in the current model, I build a better model taking care of all of them.

For example, a regression goal is predicting housing prices in an area. In this blog post, I will attempt to solve a supervised regression problem using the famous Boston housing price data set. Other than location and square footage, a house value is determined by various other factors. The data used in this blog is taken from Kaggle . It originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. The data frame contains the following columns: crim : per capita crime rate by town. zn : proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft. indus : proportion of non-retail business acres per town. chas : Charles River categorical variable (tract bounds or otherwise). nox : nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million). rm : average number of rooms per dwelling. age : proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940. dis : weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres. rad : index of accessibility to radial highways. tax : full-value property-tax rate per $10,000. ptratio : pupil-teacher ratio by town. black : racial discrimination factor. lstat : lower status of the population (percent) The target variable is medv : median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s. In particular, in this blog I want to use multiple linear regression for the analysis.

Observations: 1. If I look at rad and tax , I observe that there seem to be two categories. Houses having rad < 10 follow a normal distribution, and there are some houses with rad = 24. As rad is an index, it could also be thought of as a categorical variable instead of a continuous variable. 2. For data points with rad = 25, the behaviour in location based features looks different. For example indus , tax and ptratio have a different slope at the same points where the rad is 24. (observation for variation plots(top left plots)) Therefore, I am tempted to group the houses which have rad = 24 into one category, and create interaction variables of that column with rad , indus , ptratio and tax . The new variable is called rad_cat . Also, I would like to convert rad itself to categorical and see if it can explain better than continuous variable. Additionally, from researching on the internet, I found that the cost might have a different slope with the number of bedrooms for different class of people.

By removing industry from the initial model, the AIC is 1293.6 vs the AIC of 1297.43. Therefore, industry was removed. 4. Adding or removing any other variable does not decrease AIC significantly. The remaining factors are the best factors of the final model. Observations: 1. For every unit increase in crime, the price decreases by 0.12 units. 2. For every large residential properties, the price increases by 0.0421 units. 3. For every unit increase in NOX(pollution) levels, the price decreases by -17.25 units. 4. The presence of Charles River in track bounds increases the price of the property by 2.03 units. 5. One extra room increases the price by 4.12 6. Increase in average distance from work centres by 1 unit decreases the price by 1.47 units. 7. Increase in tax by one unit decreases the price by -0.01 units. 8. Surprisingly, increasing the parent teacher ratio by one unit, decreases the price by 0.96 units. 9. Racial discrimination is still an important factor. 10. One unit increase of lower status of the population decreases the price by 0.52 units. 11. The presence of 'rad=24' increases the price by 5.6 units.","title":"Initial Model Training"},{"location":"R/Linear-regression/#model-diagnostics","text":"I want to look at R-Squared and adjusted R-Square of the model on the test data.

This is because, in the real world, there are always random effects that cause randomness in even the most predictable events. Randomness is found in daily life to research conducted to business applications we encounter. Probability is a field which provides us with tools to fight against uncertainty and is, therefore, the backbone of statistics, econometrics, game theory and machine learning. Elements of the probabilistic model \u00b6 Let us take an experiment where the potential outcomes are \\(\\omega_1, \\omega_2,...\\) . For example, if we roll a six-sided die, the outcomes are \\(\\omega_1 = 1, \\omega_2 = 2, \\omega_3 = 3, \\omega_4 = 4, \\omega_5 = 5, \\omega_6 = 6\\) . This set of all outcomes is called a sample space and is denoted by \\(\\Omega\\) . A subset of the sample space is called an event . For example, getting 3 or 4 in a six-headed die roll is an event. Laws of probability \u00b6 Which event is more likely to occur and which event is less likely to occur. This is explained by using a probability function P(A). There are four laws of probability: 1. \\(0 \\leq P(A) \\leq 1\\) : The probability of an event is between 0 and 100%. 2. \\(P(\\Omega) = 1\\) : the probability of the sample space is 1. 3. If event A and event B are disjoint, then \\(P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)\\) . 4. If events \\(A_i\\) are pairwise disjoint events, i.e. \\(A_i \\cap A_j = \\phi\\) , then \\(P(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty}A_i) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty P(A_i)\\) Any probability function that satisfies these three axioms are considered to be a valid probability function. Some properties that can be derived from these axioms are: 1. \\(P(A^C) = 1-P(A)\\) 2. \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cup B)\\) 3. If \\(A \\subset B\\) then \\(P(A) \\leq P(B)\\) 4. If \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)\\) , then A and B are independent Conditional probability \u00b6 Let A and B be two events from the same sample space. The conditional probability of A given B is the probability of A happening if B has already taken place. This is given by \\(P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\\) From the above, we can get the following: 1. \\(P(A \\cap B) = P(B)\\times P(A|B) = P(A)\\times P(B|A)\\) 2. \\(P(A) = \\sum_{i=1}^n P(A|B_i)\\times P(B_i)\\) where \\(B_i\\) form a partition of the sample space. This is called as the formula of total probability Bayes theorem \u00b6 If A and B are two events where P(A)>0, then \\(P(A | B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{\\sum_{i=1}^n P(B|A_i)\\times P(A_i)}\\) where \\(A_j\\) 's form a partition of the sample space \\(\\cup_{i=1}^{\\infty}A_i = \\Omega\\) and for \\(i\\neq j, A_i \\neq A_j\\) Random Variables \u00b6 Random variables will help us understand the probability distributions. A random variable maps the outcomes from an experiment from the sample space to a numerical quantity. For example, if we flip a coin four times, we can get the following outcomes with H for heads and T for Tails: HTHT, HHTT, HHHT, TTTH, TTTT etc. if we take a variable that measures the number of heads in the series, we get a mapping like: HTHT - 2; HHTT - 2; HHHT - 3; TTTH - 1; TTTT - 0 and so on. The randomness of a random variable is attached to the event, and not the experiment. Random variables are this mapping which maps the outcomes of the experiment to numerical quantities. There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous random variables. The range of a discrete random variable contains a finite or countably infinite sequence of values. Some examples are: 1. No of heads in 10 coin flips: finite 2. The number of flips of a coin until heads appear: countable infinite Continuous random variables have their range as an interval of real numbers which can be finite or infinite. An example would be the time until the next customer arrives in a store. Distribution functions \u00b6 Distribution functions are used to characterise the behaviour of random variables, like the mean, standard deviation and probabilities. There are two types of distribution functions, probability distribution functions and cumulative distribution functions. For discrete random variables, we use probability mass function , which is the probability that a random variable will take a specific value. For continuous random variables, the probability of a random variable will be in an interval is arrived by integrating the probability density function. The *cumulative distribution functions depict the variable will take the value less than equal to the range. Two random variables \\(Y_1\\) and \\(Y_2\\) are said to be independent of each other if \\(P(Y_1 \\in A, Y_2 \\in B) = P(Y_1 \\in A)\\times P(Y_2 \\in B)\\) Discrete random variables \u00b6 For discrete random variables, the PMF and CDF are defined as follows: $$ PMF = p_X(x) := P(X = x) $$ $$ CMF = F_X(x) := P(X\\leq x) $$ The mean and variance of discrete random variables Let X be a random variable with range { \\(x_1, x_2, ...\\) }. The mean and variance of a random variable are given by: Expected value (Mean): \\(E[X] := \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\times P(X=x_i)\\) Variance: \\(Var(X) := E[(X-E[X])^2] = E[X^2]-E[X]^2\\) Standard Deviation \\(SD(X) = \\sqrt{Var(X)}\\) If two events X and Y are independent, then 1. E[XY] = E[X]E[Y] 2. \\(Var(aX+bY) = a^2Var(X) + b^2 Var(Y)\\) Bernoulli distribution \u00b6 Imagine an experiment that can have two outcomes, success or failure but not both. We call such an experiment as a Bernoulli trial. Consider the random variable X, which assigns 1 when we have success and 0 when we have a failure. If the probability of success is 'p', then the Probability mass function is given by: \\(P(X=x)=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll} p \\qquad x=1\\\\ 1-p \\quad x=0 \\end{array} \\right.\\) Consider flipping a coin which has a probability of heads as 60%(probability of success) 100 times. Below is a simulation of the same: dist <- rbinom ( 100 , 1 , 0.6 ) plot ( dist ) The PMF and CDF of Bernoulli distribution are as shown: range <- c ( 0 , 1 ) pmf <- dbinom ( x = range , size = 1 , prob = 0.6 ) cdf <- pbinom ( q = range , size = 1 , prob = 0.6 ) plot_pmf ( pmf , range ) plot_cdf ( cdf , range ) The mean and variance of the Bernoulli distribution is \\(E[X] = p\\) and \\(Var(X) = p\\times q\\) This can be verified using the below code mean ( dist ) ## [1] 0.54 var ( dist ) ## [1] 0.2509091 Binomial distribution \u00b6 Imagine an experiment where we are repeating independent Bernoulli trails n times. Then we can characterise this distribution using only two parameters, the success probability p and the number of trails n. If we have r successes out of n trials, we represent the probability of that event happening using a binomial distribution. The PMF of the binomial distribution is given as \\(P(X=x)=(^nc_r)\\times p^r\\times q^{n-r}\\) A binomial random variable is the sum of n Bernoulli distributions. Consider flipping a coin 10 times which has a probability of heads as 60%(probability of success). For the range 0 to 10, the total number of heads in 10 flips is simulated below: dist <- rbinom ( 100 , 10 , 0.6 ) plot ( dist ) The PMF and CDF of bernoulli distribution are as shown: range <- c ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) pmf <- dbinom ( x = range , size = 10 , prob = 0.6 ) cdf <- pbinom ( q = range , size = 10 , prob = 0.6 ) plot_pmf ( pmf , range ) plot_cdf ( cdf , range ) The mean and variance of the binomial distribution are \\(E[X] = np\\) and \\(Var[X] = npq\\) This can be derived as shown below and verified using the below code: Derivations: \\(E[X] = E[Z_1 + Z_2 + ...] = E[Z_1] + E[Z_2] +E[Z_3] + ...E[Z_n] = np\\) where \\(Z_1, Z_2..Z_n\\) are Bernoulli events which constitute the binomial distribution. \\(Var[x] = Var[Z_1 + Z_2 + ...] = Var[Z_1] + Var[Z_2] +Var[Z_3] + ...Var[Z_n] = npq\\) as \\(Z_1, Z_2..Z_n\\) are independent. The same can also be verified by taking the mean and variance of the sample data: mean ( dist ) ## [1] 6.11 var ( dist ) ## [1] 2.523131 Geometric distribution \u00b6 Imagine an experiment where we are repeating independent Bernoulli trails n times. We can characterise this distribution using only two parameters, the success probability p and the number of trails n. Consider the event where we get the first success after n failures. The distribution associated with this event is the geometric distribution. The PMF of the binomial distribution is given as \\(P(X=x)=p\\times (1-p)^{r}\\) The range of this function is all Real Values from 0,1,2,3,4,... Consider flipping a coin unitil we get heads, where the probability of heads is 50%(probability of success). For the range 0 to 10, the probability of n failures until the first heads is given by: dist <- rgeom ( 100 , 0.5 ) plot ( dist ) The PMF and CDF of Geometric distribution are as shown: range <- c ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 ) pmf <- dgeom ( x = range , prob = 0.5 ) cdf <- pgeom ( q = range , prob = 0.5 ) plot_pmf ( pmf , range ) plot_cdf ( cdf , range ) The mean and variance of the geometric distribution are \\(E[X] = \\frac{q}{p}\\) and \\(Var[X] = \\frac{q}{p^2}\\) This can be derived as shown below and verified using the below code: Derivations: \\(E[X] = 0p+1qp+2q^2p+3q^3p+..=qp(1+2q+3q^2+..) = qp\\frac{1}{(1-q)^2} = q/p\\) \\(Var[x] = E[X^2]-E[X]^2 = (0p+1qp+4q^2p+9q^3p+..) -(\\frac{q}{p})^2 = \\frac{q}{p^2}\\) The same can also be verified by taking the mean and variance of the sample data: mean ( dist ) ## [1] 0.86 var ( dist ) ## [1] 1.232727 Poisson distribution \u00b6 The Poisson distribution is used when we are counting the number of successes in an interval of time. Usually, in these situations, the probability of an event occurring at a particular time is small. For example, we might be interested in counting the number of customers that arrive in a bus stand in a period of time. This random variable might follow a Poisson distribution as the probability of success; someone coming to the bus stand at any tick of time is small. Only one parameter is used to define the Poisson distribution, i.e. \\(\\lambda\\) , which is the average rate of arrivals we are interested in. The PMF is defined as $$ P(X=x)= \\frac{\\lambda xe }{x!} $$ The range of this function is all Real Values from 0,1,2,3,4,... For a Poisson distribution of \\(\\lambda =10\\) , we have dist <- rpois ( 100 , 10 ) plot ( dist ) The PMF and CDF of Poisson distribution are as shown: range <- c ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 ) pmf <- dpois ( x = range , lambda = 10 ) cdf <- ppois ( q = range , lambda = 10 ) plot_pmf ( pmf , range ) plot_cdf ( cdf , range ) The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are \\(E[X] = \\lambda\\) and \\(Var[X] = \\lambda\\) This can be derived as shown below and verified using the below code: Derivations: \\(E[X] = \\sum x\\frac{\\lambda^xe^{-\\lambda}}{x!} = \\lambda \\sum\\frac{\\lambda^{x-1}e^{-1}}{(x-1)!} = \\lambda\\) The same can also be verified by taking the mean and variance of the sample data: mean ( dist ) ## [1] 10.24 var ( dist ) ## [1] 12.28525 Continuous random variables \u00b6 Unlike discrete random variables, continuous random variables can take all real values in an interval which can be finite or infinite. A continuous random variable X has a probability density function \\(f_X(X)\\) . PDF is different from PMF while its usage in calculating the probability of an event is similar. For instance, the probability of an event A is calculated by summing the probabilities of each discrete variable(PMF), while we integrate the probabilities for all the outcomes for continuous variables(PDF). Similarly, for CDF, we integrate from \\(-\\infty\\) to x. \\(PDF:= f_X(x)\\) \\(P(X\\in A) = \\int_A f_X(y) dy\\) \\(CDF:= F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{x} f_x(y) dy\\) Therefore PDF and CDF are lated by \\(\\frac{d}{dx}F(X) = f(x)\\) and \\(P(X \\in (x+\\epsilon, x-\\epsilon)) = 2\\epsilon \\times f(x)\\) . Uniform distribution \u00b6 The uniform distribution is used when we do not have the underlying distribution at hand. We make a simplifying assumption that every element in our range has the same probability of occurring. The PDF of a uniform distribution is given by: \\(PDF:= f(x) = \\frac{1}{b-a}, \\, x \\in (a,b)\\) We need two parameters to characterise a uniform distribution, which is a and b . The distribution is as shown: dist <- runif ( n = 100 , min = 5 , max = 10 ) plot ( dist ) The PDF and CDF are plotted below: range <- 1 : 150 / 10 pdf <- dunif ( x = range , min = 5 , max = 10 ) cdf <- punif ( q = range , min = 5 , max = 10 ) plot_pdf ( pdf , range ) plot_cdf_continuous ( cdf , range ) For the uniform distribution, the mean is \\(E[X]=\\frac{a+b}{2}\\) and variance is \\(Var[X] = \\frac{(a-b)^2}{12}\\) . This can be proven using: \\(E[X] = \\int_a^bx\\times\\frac{1}{b-a}dx = \\frac{a+b}{2}\\) \\(Var[X] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = \\int_a^b x^2\\times \\frac{1}{b-a}dx - (\\frac{a+b}{2})^2 = \\frac{(b^3-a^3)}{3(b-a)}- \\frac{(a+b)^2}{4} = \\frac{a^2+b^2+ab}{4}-\\frac{(a+b)^2}{4} = \\frac{(a-b)^2}{12}\\) The same can also be verified by taking the mean and variance of the sample data: mean ( dist ) ## [1] 7.592581 var ( dist ) ## [1] 2.017721 Exponential distribution \u00b6 In the geometric distribution, we looked at the probability of first success happening after n failures. In the exponential distribution, we look at the time taken until which an event occurs, or time elapsed between events. Only one parameter is sufficient to describe an exponential distribution, \\(\\lambda\\) which describes the successes per unit time. The PDF of an exponential distribution is given as: \\(PDF:= f(x) = \\lambda\\times e^{-\\lambda x}\\) The CDF can be derived as \\(CDF = P(X<x) = F(X) = \\int_0^x \\lambda\\times e^{-\\lambda y} dy = 1-e^{-\\lambda x}\\) Therefore 1-CDF can be written as \\(P(X>x) = e^{-\\lambda x}\\) The intervel \\(x>0\\) and \\(\\lambda>0\\) . The distribution if an event happens on an average once every two minutes is as shown: dist <- rexp ( n = 100 , rate = 0.5 ) plot ( dist ) The PDF and CDF are plotted below: range <- 1 : 150 / 10 pdf <- dexp ( x = range , rate = 0.5 ) cdf <- pexp ( q = range , rate = 0.5 ) plot_pdf ( pdf , range ) plot_cdf_continuous ( cdf , range ) For the exponential distribution, the mean is \\(E[X]=\\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\) and variance is \\(Var[X] = \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\) . The same can also be verified by taking the mean and variance of the sample data: mean ( dist ) ## [1] 2.309103 var ( dist ) ## [1] 5.504272 Normal distribution \u00b6 The normal distribution is the most famous continuous distribution. It has a unique bell-shaped curve. Randomness generally presents as a normal distribution. It is widespread in nature. Two parameters define a normal distribution, its mean \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation \\(\\sigma\\) . \\(PDF:= f(x) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi \\sigma^2}e^{-\\frac{(x-\\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\\) The distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2 is as shown: dist <- rnorm ( n = 100 , mean = 10 , sd = 2 ) plot ( dist ) The PDF and CDF are plotted below: range <- 50 : 150 / 10 pdf <- dnorm ( x = range , mean = 10 , sd = 2 ) cdf <- pnorm ( q = range , mean = 10 , sd = 2 ) plot_pdf ( pdf , range ) plot_cdf_continuous ( cdf , range ) References \u00b6 Blitzstein, JK and Hwang, J (2014).

The data and EDA for the same can be found in the above link. You can find the same in my git repository. The historical demand for Lettuce for the first ten days is shown below.

The quantity of Lettuce used seems to depend on the day of the week. From this plot, there seems to be no discernible trend in the quantity of Lettuce used. Visualising seasonality \u00b6 We can visualise this seasonality using seasonal plots. From these plots, we can see that the demand for Lettuce is the least on Tuesday while highest on Wednesdays. Thus, a clear weekly seasonality in the data can be observed in the data. The same is more evident in polar coordinates. We can see the similarity in demand within weekdays by looking at the seasonal subseries plots where data for each weekday is collected together. The mean and the variance across weeks for each of the weekdays can be seen. SARIMA \u00b6 As the data is seasonal, we will need to use SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA). By looking at these plots, I suspect that the series is stationary. This can be validated using Dickey-Fuller and KPSS tests. Dickey\u2212Fuller Test \u00b6 Dickey\u2212Fuller test is a hypothesis test in which the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are given by \\(H_0\\) : \\(\\gamma\\) = 0 (the time series is non-stationary) \\(H_1\\) : \\(\\gamma\\) < 0 (the time series is stationary) Where $$ \\Delta y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\gamma y_{t-1} + \\delta_1 \\Delta y_{t-1} + \\delta_2 \\Delta y_{t-2} + \\dots $$ ## ## Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test ## ## data: time.series ## Dickey-Fuller = -8.4973, Lag order = 4, p-value = 0.01 ## alternative hypothesis: stationary As p value is less than the cutoff \\(\\alpha = 5\\%\\) , rejecting the null hypothesis that the time series is non-stationary. The time series is stationary.

ACF and PACF plots \u00b6 The ACF and PACF plots of this time series are: From the ACF plot, I can see a correlation within multiples of 7, indicating a weekly seasonality. However, the PACF shows no such trend after the first iteration. Stationarity in the seasonal component \u00b6 To test if the seasonal component is also stationary, we can look at the time series after differencing with period 7 (which will remove the seasonal non-stationarity if it exists). After differencing once with period 7, we can determine if the data is still stationary using the KPSS test. We can also use the nsdiff function in R to find the differencing factor to make the data stationary. library ( urca ) diff ( time.series , 7 ) %>% ur.kpss %>% summary () ## ## ####################### ## # KPSS Unit Root Test # ## ####################### ## ## Test is of type: mu with 3 lags. ## ## Value of test-statistic is: 0.0759 ## ## Critical value for a significance level of: ## 10pct 5pct 2.5pct 1pct ## critical values 0.347 0.463 0.574 0.739 # Number of differencing necessary on the data to bring to stationarity time.series %>% nsdiffs () ## [1] 1 # After differencing with period 7, we are checking for stationarity time.series %>% diff ( lag = 7 ) %>% nsdiffs () ## [1] 0 We can see that the seasonality component is not stationary and can be made stationary by differencing once (with period 7).

To reduce over-fitting, we can reduce the data into training and test datasets. We will use the train dataset to train, and compare the accuracy on the test dataset. As we have around 15 weeks of data (15 th week is not full), we can use the first 13 weeks for training and the remaining 14 th and 15 th week for testing. ## ## ARIMA(2,0,2)(1,1,1)[7] with drift : 810.332 ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[7] with drift : 835.2064 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(1,1,0)[7] with drift : 814.9145 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] with drift : 803.1689 ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,0)[7] : 833.1092 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,0)[7] with drift : 837.2882 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,1)[7] with drift : 805.3521 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,2)[7] with drift : 805.3646 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[7] with drift : 814.7505 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,2)[7] with drift : Inf ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,1)[7] with drift : 803.6079 ## ARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] with drift : 805.3438 ## ARIMA(0,0,2)(0,1,1)[7] with drift : 805.3646 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[7] with drift : 803.3737 ## ARIMA(1,0,2)(0,1,1)[7] with drift : 807.6387 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] : 801.7491 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,0)[7] : 835.1395 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,1)[7] : 803.949 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,2)[7] : 803.9496 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,0)[7] : 812.5485 ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(1,1,2)[7] : 806.0826 ## ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,1)[7] : 802.3558 ## ARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] : 803.897 ## ARIMA(0,0,2)(0,1,1)[7] : 803.916 ## ARIMA(1,0,0)(0,1,1)[7] : 801.9277 ## ARIMA(1,0,2)(0,1,1)[7] : 806.1242 ## ## Best model: ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] ## Series: train.time.series ## ARIMA(0,0,1)(0,1,1)[7] ## ## Coefficients: ## ma1 sma1 ## 0.1883 -0.7976 ## s.e. 0.1107 0.1208 ## ## sigma^2 estimated as 639.5: log likelihood=-397.73 ## AIC=801.45 AICc=801.75 BIC=808.78 ## ## Training set error measures: ## ME RMSE MAE MPE MAPE MASE ## Training set -0.3200893 24.02014 17.54746 -2.825856 13.15411 0.6661607 ## ACF1 ## Training set 0.001434103 The model selected using AIC coefficient is ARIMA(0, 0, 1) with a seasonal component (0, 1, 1) with frequency 7.

In the first post, we discussed stationarity, random walk and other concepts. In this blog, we are going to discuss various ways one can test for stationarity. Two types of tests are introduced in this blog 1. Unit root tests 2. Independence tests Data \u00b6 For the following blog, we will use a sample from attendance data set described in EDA blogs. From the time series and ACF plots, one can observe non-stationarity and decreasing trend. Unit root tests \u00b6 As discussed in the previous blog, unit root stochastic process is another name for Random walk process. A random walk process can be written as $$ Y_t=\\rho \\times Y_{t\u22121} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\rho = 1\\) . If \\(|\\rho|<1\\) then the process represents Markov first order auto regressive model which is stationary. Only for \\(\\rho=1\\) we get non-stationary. The above equation can be alternatively written as $$ Y_t - Y_{t-1} = \\Delta Y_t = \\delta \\times Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\delta = \\rho -1\\) . For non-stationarity, the condition now becomes \\(\\delta = 0\\) the alternative hypothesis being \\(\\delta < 0\\) . The null and alternate hypothesis are: $$ H_0: \\delta = 0 $$ $$ H_1 : \\delta < 0 $$ Under this null hypothesis, \\(Y_{t-1}\\) does not follow a normal distribution(or t-distribution). Dickey and Fuller have shown that for the above null and alternate hypothesis, the estimated test statistic follows the \\(\\tau\\) statistic. If the hypothesis that \\(\\delta=0\\) is rejected, that is if the series is stationary, then we can use the t-test for further analysis. Dickey Fuller tests \u00b6 The Dickey fuller tests contains two steps. 1. Test if the series is stationary 2. If the series is not stationary, test what kind of non-stationarity is present As non-stationarity can exist in three ways, the dickey fuller test is estimated in three different forms \\(Y_t\\) is a random walk : \\(\\Delta Y_t = \\delta Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\) \\(Y_t\\) is a random walk with drift : \\(\\Delta Y_t = \\beta_1 + \\delta Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\) \\(Y_t\\) is a random walk with drift around a deterministic trend : \\(\\Delta Y_t = \\beta_1 + \\beta_2 t +\\delta Y_{t-1} + \\epsilon_t\\) In each case, the null hypothesis is that \\(\\delta = 0\\) , i.e., there is a unit root\u2014the time series is non-stationary. The alternative hypothesis is that \\(\\delta < 0\\) that is, the time series is stationary. If the null hypothesis is rejected , it means the following in the three scenarios: 1. \\(Y_t\\) is a stationary time series with zero mean in the case of random walk 2. \\(Y_t\\) is stationary with a non-zero mean in the case of random walk with drift 3. \\(Y_t\\) is stationary around a deterministic trend in case of random walk with drift around a deterministic trend The actual estimation procedure is as follows: 1. Perform the tests from backwards, i.e., estimate deterministic trend first, then random walk with drift and then random walk. This is to ensure we are not committing specification error 2. For the three tests, estimate the \\(\\tau\\) statistic and compare with the (MacKinnon) critical tau values, If the computed absolute value of the tau statistic ( \\(|\\tau|\\) ) exceeds the critical tau values, we reject the Null hypothesis in which case the time series is stationary 3. If any of the ( \\(\\tau\\) ) values are less than the critical tau value, then we retain the Null hypothesis in which case the time series is non-stationary. The critical \\(\\tau\\) values can vary between the three tests For the attendance data, the Dickey fuller tests give the following results: ## ======================================================================== ## At the 5pct level: ## The test is for type random walk ## delta=0: The null hypothesis is not rejected, the series is not stationary ## ======================================================================== ## ======================================================================== ## At the 5pct level: ## The test is for type random walk with drift ## delta=0: The first null hypothesis is not rejected, the series is not stationary ## delta=0 and beta1=0: The second null hypothesis is rejected, the series is not stationary ## and there is drift. ## ======================================================================== ## ======================================================================== ## At the 5pct level: ## The test is for type random walk with drift and deterministic trend ## delta=0: The first null hypothesis is not rejected, the series is not stationary ## delta=0 and beta2=0: The second null hypothesis is rejected, the series is not stationary ## and there is trend ## delta=0 and beta1=0 and beta2=0: The third null hypothesis is rejected, the series is not stationary ## there is trend, and there may or may not be drift ## Warning in interp_urdf(ur.df(time.series, type = \"trend\")): Presence of drift is inconclusive. ## ======================================================================== The above result should be interpreted as follows (read backwards): 3. There might be a deterministic trend in the series there may or may not be a drift coefficient 2. The series is non-stationary and there is drift coefficient 1. The series is non-stationary Therefore, the series is not stationary. Augmented Dickey\u2212Fuller Test \u00b6 In conducting the DF test, it was assumed that the error term was uncorrelated. But in case the \\(\\epsilon_t\\) are correlated, Dickey and Fuller have developed a test, known as the augmented Dickey\u2013Fuller (ADF) test. This test is conducted by \u201caugmenting\u201d the three equations by adding the lagged values of the dependent variable. The null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis are given by \\(H_0\\) : \\(\\gamma\\) = 0 (the time series is non-stationary) \\(H_1\\) : \\(\\gamma\\) < 0 (the time series is stationary) Where $$ \\Delta y_t = \\alpha + \\beta t + \\gamma y_{t-1} + \\delta_1 \\Delta y_{t-1} + \\delta_2 \\Delta y_{t-2} + \\dots $$ Ljung\u2013Box independence test \u00b6 Ljung\u2212Box is a test of lack of fit of the forecasting model and checks whether the auto-correlations for the errors are different from zero. The null and alternative hypotheses are given by \\(H_0\\) : The model does not show lack of fit \\(H_1\\) : The model exhibits lack of fit The Ljung\u2212Box statistic (Q-Statistic) is given by $$ Q(m) = n(n+2) \\sum_{k=1} {m}\\frac{\\rho_k 2}{n-k}$$ where n is the number of observations in the time series, k is the number of lag, \\(r_k\\) is the auto-correlation of lag k, and m is the total number of lags. Q-statistic is an approximate chi-square distribution with m \u2013 p \u2013 q degrees of freedom where p and q are the AR and MA lags. ## ## Box-Ljung test ## ## data: time.series ## X-squared = 1070.9, df = 10, p-value < 2.2e-16 Therefore from Ljung box test, we can conclude that the model shows a lack of fit with stationary process.

It doesn't deal with causes or relationships and it's major purpose is to describe; it takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data. In describing or characterizing the observations of an individual variable, there are three basic properties that are of interest: The location of observations, or how large or small the values of the individual observations are The dispersion (sometimes called scale or spread) of the observations The distribution of the observations Uni-variate plots provide one way to find out about those properties. There are two basic kinds of uni variate plots: Enumeration plots, or plots that show every observation Summary plots, that generalize the data into a simplified representation. For the current tutorial, I will be using my office attendance data set. The data set contains the time when I swiped into office and the time when I swiped out of office. Data from 4 th October 2017 to 29 th November 2018. After some manipulation on the data set, I will get the difference between policy out-time and my actual out-time. I can leave from 15 minutes before the policy out time. A sample of the data after manipulation is as follows: (Actual data is not shown for security reasons. This is mock data which is very similar to the actual one.) ## Attendance.Date diff.in.time diff.out.time ## 1 2018-03-22 18 mins 226 mins ## 2 2018-08-14 -9 mins 5 mins ## 3 2017-12-04 42 mins 11 mins ## 4 2018-03-01 26 mins -6 mins ## 5 2018-01-23 35 mins -4 mins Summary Statistics \u00b6 Some basic summary statistics before further analysis would me the basic mean and standard deviation of the data. For this tutorial, I will use diff.in.time (difference between actual in-time and policy in-time) mean ( as.numeric ( attendance $ diff.out.time )) # Mean in minutes ## [1] 20.3227 sd ( as.numeric ( attendance $ diff.out.time )) # Standard Deviation in minutes ## [1] 69.06549 nrow ( attendance ) # Length of the data set ## [1] 282 Enumerative plots \u00b6 \"Enumerative plots\" are called such because they enumerate or show every individual data point Index Plot/Univariate Scatter Diagram \u00b6 Displays the values of a single variable for each observation using symbols plotted relative to the observation number. ggplot ( attendance , aes ( x = Attendance.Date , y = as.numeric ( diff.out.time ), color = ( diff.out.time >= -15 ))) + geom_point ( show.legend = FALSE ) + labs ( x = 'Time' , y = 'Out-time difference (Minutes)' ) + theme_minimal () Just looking at this plot I can say the following: I could cluster into three parts, One cluster would be before December 2017, where I used to leave office way after my out-time, second cluster would be from December 2017 to June 2018, where I used to leave office 15 minutes before my out time, and after June 2018, when I was leaving way after my out-time. The red dots indicate the days when I came to office after 15 minutes from in-time. They are anomalies, days when I took half days etc.. We can exclude them from our current analysis. Y Zero High-Density Plot \u00b6 Another way to look at the same data is by using a Y Zero High-Density Plot. It displays the values of a single variable plotted as thin vertical lines. Here the magnitude of the observations are highlighted. ggplot ( attendance , aes ( x = Attendance.Date , y = 0 , color = ( diff.out.time >= -15 ), xend = Attendance.Date , yend = as.numeric ( diff.out.time ))) + geom_segment ( show.legend = FALSE ) + labs ( x = 'Time' , y = 'Out-time difference (Minutes)' ) + theme_minimal () Removing half-days as outliers attendance <- attendance %>% filter ( diff.out.time >= -15 ) Strip Plot/Strip Chart (univariate scatter diagram) \u00b6 Displays the values of a single variable as symbols plotted along a line. This is a basic plot where we can see the spread of the data. stripchart ( x = as.numeric ( attendance $ diff.out.time ), xlab = 'Out-time difference (minutes)' ) Sometimes it is more visually apparent when the points are stacked. ggplot ( attendance , aes ( x = as.numeric ( diff.out.time ), y = ..density.. )) + geom_dotplot ( binwidth = 3 , method = 'histodot' ) + labs ( x = 'Out-time difference (minutes)' ) + theme_minimal () We can observe that the number of observations are high at the starting and slowly tend to drop as time progresses. Dot Plot/Dot Chart \u00b6 Displays the values of a single variable as symbols plotted along a line. With a separate line for each observation, it is generally constructed after sorting the rows of the data table. df = attendance %>% arrange ( as.numeric ( diff.out.time )) ggplot ( df , aes ( x = as.numeric ( row.names ( df )), y = as.numeric ( diff.out.time ))) + geom_point () + labs ( x = 'count' , y = 'Out time difference (min)' ) + theme_minimal () From the graph I can observe that the distribution initially seems to be a exponential distribution. A sample normal distribution is plotted for reference. We can see that the distribution looks no where like a normal distribution. I suspect that it is close to a exponential distribution. Univariate Summary Plots \u00b6 Summary plots display an object or a graph that gives a more concise expression of the location, dispersion, and distribution of a variable than an enumerative plot, but this comes at the expense of some loss of information: In a summary plot, it is no longer possible to retrieve the individual data value, but this loss is usually matched by the gain in understanding that results from the efficient representation of the data. Summary plots generally prove to be much better than the enumerative plots in revealing the distribution of the data. Box plot \u00b6 A simple way of representing statistical data on a plot in which a rectangle is drawn to represent the second and third quartiles, usually with a vertical line inside to indicate the median value. The lower and upper quartiles are shown as horizontal lines either side of the rectangle. ggplot ( attendance , aes ( x = \"Box Plot\" , y = as.numeric ( diff.out.time ), group = 123 )) + geom_boxplot () + labs ( y = 'Out time difference (min)' ) + theme_minimal () Histograms \u00b6 The other summary plots are of various types: Histograms: Histograms are a type of bar chart that displays the counts or relative frequencies of values falling in different class intervals or ranges. Density Plots: A density plot is a plot of the local relative frequency or density of points along the number line or x-axis of a plot. The local density is determined by summing the individual \"kernel\" densities for each point. Where points occur more frequently, this sum, and consequently the local density, will be greater. legendcols <- c ( \"Normal distribution\" = \"darkred\" , \"Density\" = \"darkBlue\" , \"Histogram\" = \"lightBlue\" ) ggplot ( attendance , aes ( x = as.numeric ( diff.out.time ))) + geom_histogram ( aes ( y = ..density.. , fill = \"Histogram\" ), bins = 50 ) + stat_function ( fun = dnorm , aes ( color = \"Normal distribution\" ), size = 1 , args = list ( mean = mean ( as.numeric ( attendance $ diff.out.time )), sd = sd ( as.numeric ( attendance $ diff.out.time )) )) + geom_density ( aes ( y = ..density.. , color = \"Density\" ), size = 1 ) + scale_colour_manual ( name = \"Distribution\" , values = legendcols ) + scale_fill_manual ( name = \"Bar\" , values = legendcols ) + labs ( x = 'Out-time difference (minutes)' , y = 'Density' ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) In the above graph, the red line is normal distribution(with the same mean and sd) while the blue line is the density plot of in-time. Q-Q plot \u00b6 In statistics, a Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plot is a probability plot, which is a graphical method for comparing two probability distributions by plotting their quantiles against each other. If the two distributions being compared are similar, the points in the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on the line y = x. If the distributions are linearly related, the points in the Q-Q plot will approximately lie on a line, but not necessarily on the line y = x. Q-Q plots can also be used as a graphical means of estimating parameters in a location-scale family of distributions. A Q-Q plot is used to compare the shapes of distributions, providing a graphical view of how properties such as location, scale, and skewness are similar or different in the two distributions.

It doesn't deal with causes or relationships and it's major purpose is to describe; it takes data, summarizes that data and finds patterns in the data. In describing or characterizing the observations of an individual variable, there are three basic properties that are of interest: The location of observations, or how large or small the values of the individual observations are The dispersion (sometimes called scale or spread) of the observations The distribution of the observations Uni-variate plots provide one way to find out about those properties. There are two basic kinds of uni variate plots: Enumeration plots, or plots that show every observation Summary plots, that generalize the data into a simplified representation.

In retail stores, people usually buy multiple products with a large range across a variety of products. Sales of different products are correlated, for example, if a family is buying at the start of the month, they would buy all household groceries which span various products and ranges. Take another example of young fathers buying wine and diapers together at Walmart[1], or people who buy milk also buy bread. These cross-correlations in the demand make predicting demand difficult. For example, the demand for socks is also correlated with shoes, and therefore for predicting the demand for shoes, we should consider the demand for both shoes and socks from the previous periods. This makes demand forecasting more complex in retail stores as in a typical regression, these cross-correlation effects are not taken into consideration. Dual causality and complex feedback loops between the sales in departments are not considered in typical regression and demand forecasts. In this blog, we use Walmart's data to predict sales (after marketing) at various departments. The results for one particular store are taken and analysed in detail to explain in detail. Data \u00b6 The data used is taken from \"Walmart Recruiting - Store Sales Forecasting data competition\" on Kaggle[2]. This contains sales and marketing data for 99 departments and 45 stores from 2010 to 2012. At every store, external factors like CPI, unemployment, temperature, fuel price and holidays are given. Additionally, four different markdowns are given at the store level from the date 11-11-2011. ## Store Date Temperature Fuel_Price MarkDown1 MarkDown2 MarkDown3 ## 1 18 2011-05-20 57.55 4.101 NA NA NA ## 2 40 2011-01-14 18.55 3.215 NA NA NA ## 3 9 2010-11-26 60.18 2.735 NA NA NA ## 4 35 2010-02-26 36.00 2.754 NA NA NA ## 5 1 2013-02-08 56.67 3.417 32355.16 729.8 280.89 ## MarkDown4 MarkDown5 CPI Unemployment IsHoliday ## 1 NA NA 134.6804 8.975 FALSE ## 2 NA NA 132.9511 5.114 FALSE ## 3 NA NA 215.2909 6.560 TRUE ## 4 NA NA 135.5195 9.262 FALSE ## 5 20426.61 4671.78 224.2350 6.525 TRUE Department-store level sales data is also provided for every week. ## Store Dept Date Weekly_Sales IsHoliday ## 1 29 74 2011-02-11 8160.66 TRUE ## 2 45 71 2010-10-01 3399.40 FALSE ## 3 20 91 2011-02-18 86224.01 FALSE ## 4 20 5 2011-11-04 48799.61 FALSE ## 5 32 41 2012-03-16 1396.00 FALSE Assumptions \u00b6 In this analysis, the assumptions are as follows: 1. Considering only fast-moving departments: Fast-moving departments are defined as departments that have at least one item sold every day in every store. Predicting demand for slow-moving items, especially when the items are not sold at all for a few days is complex and requires a different analysis. We should check if the sales follow a Poisson distribution and model the difference of time between sales using an exponential distribution (which we are not doing in this analysis). 2. Ignoring the smaller cross-correlations between sales of departments. 3. The VAR model has an additive form. This means that the effect of cross-correlations is additive. 4. Markdowns are considered endogenous variables as the sales increase due to markdowns are present only in that period and do not spill over when the markdowns are not present. Methodology \u00b6 The sales across different departments are visualized and classified into fast-moving and slow-moving departments. Fast-moving departments are departments that have at least one item sold every day in each store. Based on correlations among the fast-moving departments, four clusters are formed. After testing for stationarity, to model sales, a VAR(1) model with sales of all the departments (in the cluster) as exogenous variables and markdowns, temperature and other demographic variables as endogenous variables is built. This model at a store level is used to predict sales of the departments in the clusters. VAR model is used to model the complex loops caused due to the correlation in sales between the departments (within a cluster). This is extended to all stores across all department clusters to predict the sales for the future. Analysis \u00b6 Scatter plots (appendix) show the total sales of the department (all stores combined) across time. The count of stores is added to identify fast-moving departments. There are a total of five types of markdowns that were active across the stores. While the markdowns are not given at the department level, we assume that markdowns affect sales across departments due to cross-correlations. The magnitude of these markdowns is plotted for each store (appendix). This shows that in almost all stores, Markdown 1 is the highest while Markdown 3 is the lowest. From the plots above, we are restricting our analysis to the following departments 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 21, 30, 38, 40, 46, 67, 79, 81, 82, 90, 91, 92, 95 as they are fast-moving. We also observe that there is no visible pattern among the markdowns. This indicates that predicting the markdowns for the past (where we have missing data) would be challenging. The correlations between the total sales of the department's can be visualized in the below correlation plot. These correlations can be used to create clusters of departments that are closely related using hierarchical clustering. Four clusters are created with minimum 3 and maximum 7 departments. The four clusters are # Four clusters c1 <- c ( 10 , 2 , 4 , 13 , 81 , 95 ) c2 <- c ( 3 , 16 , 30 ) c3 <- c ( 1 , 67 , 46 , 82 , 21 , 7 , 14 ) c4 <- c ( 38 , 40 , 90 , 92 , 79 , 91 ) The assumption is that the sales of the departments within the cluster have cross-correlations and are dependent on each other, with no influence from departments outside the cluster. In the next step, we test the stationarity of the sales in each department. The analysis for cluster 1 is demonstrated, and a similar analysis should be carried out for the remaining clusters. Cluster 1 \u00b6 With the assumption that the sales in the departments that are within cluster-1 are correlated and the departments outside the cluster do not affect the sales of the departments within the cluster, we can try to build a VAR model with department sales as exogenous variables. The first step to build a VAR model is to perform a unit root test to identify if the sales are stationary. The most common tests to test stationarity are KPSS and ADF tests. In this analysis, KPSS tests are performed, and for each department, the following steps are carried out. 1. If the data is stationary, the data is not modified. This data is represented by 'd'+department number 2. If the data is not found to be stationary, differencing is done to bring the data to stationarity and the differenced data is represented as 'Dd' + department number The KPSS test result, time series plot, ACF and PACF plots are shown for each department in cluster 1. Note, the total sales of the department (Combining all stores) is taken for the analysis. The final data (after converting to stationary) for each department is also shown. ## [1] \"Department 10\" ## ## KPSS Test for Level Stationarity ## ## data: time.series.ts ## KPSS Level = 0.37175, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.08933 ## ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 1\" ## [1] \"_____\" ## [1] \"Department 2\" ## ## KPSS Test for Level Stationarity ## ## data: time.series.ts ## KPSS Level = 0.19425, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.1 ## ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 0\" ## [1] \"_____\" ## [1] \"Department 4\" ## ## KPSS Test for Level Stationarity ## ## data: time.series.ts ## KPSS Level = 0.51039, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.03933 ## ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 1\" ## [1] \"_____\" ## [1] \"Department 13\" ## ## KPSS Test for Level Stationarity ## ## data: time.series.ts ## KPSS Level = 0.25715, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.1 ## ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 1\" ## [1] \"_____\" ## [1] \"Department 81\" ## ## KPSS Test for Level Stationarity ## ## data: time.series.ts ## KPSS Level = 0.33434, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.1 ## ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 1\" ## [1] \"_____\" ## [1] \"Department 95\" ## ## KPSS Test for Level Stationarity ## ## data: time.series.ts ## KPSS Level = 0.19382, Truncation lag parameter = 4, p-value = 0.1 ## ## [1] \"The ideal differencing parameter is 0\" ## [1] \"_____\" ## # A tibble: 6 x 7 ## Date Dd10 d2 Dd4 Dd13 Dd81 d95 ## <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> ## 1 2010-02-05 NA 1997832.

Based on the p-values in the KPSS test, departments 10, 4 are not-stationary while departments 2, 13, 81 and 95 are stationary. Testing for seasonality \u00b6 Despite making the data stationary, we can still see seasonality in some departments. As we do not have data (at least three years of data to find patterns), we are ignoring seasonality. We assume that the increase in sales in particular seasons is due to holidays. We have holidays as a proxy for some seasonal patterns. In the below plots, these seasonalities are shown. Analysis in one store \u00b6 While in the previous analysis, we have looked at the total sales of the department and identified the trends of each department, we want to predict the sales for each store. Assuming that the behaviour of the departments is similar across stores we can build VAR models for each store and department cluster. This assumption means that the correlations and clusters between departments remain the same across all stores and the departments will have the same stationary patterns across stores. In the current analysis, we demonstrate the analysis for one store (and one cluster). Similar analysis can be scaled up for multiple stores and department clusters. Null value treatment: In the data provided, there are three types of Null values. 1. For temperature, Fuel price, unemployment and CPI index, the null values are replaced with mean values in the store. This is because there is a small deviation of these numbers within a store. Assuming that the mean will be close to the actual number of these variables would be reasonable. These values do not follow a pattern and are random. 2. For markdowns after 11-11-11, null values are replaced with Zero. For markdown data after 11-11-11, any null value is assumed to be present due to no markdowns. 3. For markdowns before 11-11-11, null values are imputed with zero. This is the timeframe where we do not have reliable data. As discussed in the EDA, it is difficult to extrapolate markdowns data to the past due to a lack of sufficient length of data. VAR Model \u00b6 The last step in the model building process is to build a VAR model on the data. In the VAR(1) model, the departments (after bringing to stationarity) are exogenous variables and customer demographics and markdowns are endogenous variables. The VAR(1) model will have the following equation.

The R^2 metrics are between 32-65% indicating the percentage of demand variation that is explained by the model. Temperature is significant in all the departments. holidays are significant only in departments 10 and 2 while fuel price is not significant in any department. CPI is not-significant in departments 10 and 13 while unemployment is significant in department 2 only. Among markdowns, the first markdown is significant only for departments 10 and 4, the second for 2, 13, 81 and 95, the third and fourth markdowns are not significant, and the fifth one is significant in the department 4. From the significant variables, we can observe the following: 1. Temperature is a good proxy for seasonality. To improve the prediction, classifying temperature into different ranges might help. 2. Departments 10 and 2 have a lot of products that are commonly given as gifts during the holiday seasons. During the holiday season, these departments should be given more focus. 3. The demand for items in departments 10 and 13 is resilient to small changes in inflation and CPI. This could mean that these items might be inelastic. 4. The products in department 2 have higher sales while a customer is unemployed. 5. Not all markdowns affect the sales of different departments. For example, Markdown type 1 is useful to improve the sales of departments 10 and 4 only. More analysis on the nature of markdowns is required to understand the reasons for this trend. Markdowns can be planned more efficiently if these relationships can be analysed further. We can ask questions like \"do markdowns (of type 1) on shoes improve the sales of socks\", and \"Can I create markdowns or discounts with products across departments like a discount if shoes and socks are brought together. The effect of some markdowns is negative in some departments (in presence of other markdowns). This has to also be investigated. Sometimes, providing markdowns for some items can improve the sales in that department/product but cannibalises sales in other departments/products. 6. Department 13 is not influenced by any markdowns, indicating this could be a department of inelastic products. Walmart can relook at the pricing strategy for these items. The demand equation for the demand of department 95 at store 1 is as follows (only significant variables). $$ demand_{95, t} = 0.324\\times \\Delta sales_{10, t-1} + 0.724\\times sales_{2, t-1} -1.169\\times \\Delta sales_{4, t-1} +1.668\\times \\Delta sales_{81, t-1} + 0\\times sales_{95, t-1} + 510\\times temperature_t - 0.383\\times markdown2_{t} + 675.14\\times cpi_{t} -83971$$ From this equation, we can see that sales of products in department 2 in the previous period have a positive impact (if one hundred additional items were sold in the previous period in department 2, 72 additional units will be sold in department 95). Similarly, departments 13 and 81 also have a positive impact on sales. Department 4 has a negative impact on sales (for one additional unit increase in sales in department 4, the sales in the current period decreased by 1.16 units). The previous period demand has no significance (in presence of other variables). Predictions \u00b6 Finally, using the VAR(1) model, we can predict the demand in each department for different values of markdowns and other exogenous variables. For example, with the same markdowns and demographic values the demand prediction for the next 10 time periods is provided. Additionally, their confidence intervals are also provided. ## [1] 1907.21184 1392.08756 1121.89931 -926.18603 -50.90932 -937.08478 ## [7] -527.70790 244.23242 -403.57184 -469.50484 Ending \u00b6 The above analysis demonstrates how to forecast demand when correlations between different departments/products exist. We have also looked into the effect of different types of markdowns on different departments. Analysing further into the details of the markdowns can help us design markdowns more efficiently. We have also seen that temperature can be a proxy for seasonality in the data. Finally, we have shown how the demand for different products/departments affects demand due to cross-correlations and how to model them.

In retail stores, people usually buy multiple products with a large range across a variety of products. Sales of different products are correlated, for example, if a family is buying at the start of the month, they would buy all household groceries which span various products and ranges. Take another example of young fathers buying wine and diapers together at Walmart[1], or people who buy milk also buy bread. These cross-correlations in the demand make predicting demand difficult. For example, the demand for socks is also correlated with shoes, and therefore for predicting the demand for shoes, we should consider the demand for both shoes and socks from the previous periods. This makes demand forecasting more complex in retail stores as in a typical regression, these cross-correlation effects are not taken into consideration. Dual causality and complex feedback loops between the sales in departments are not considered in typical regression and demand forecasts. In this blog, we use Walmart's data to predict sales (after marketing) at various departments. The results for one particular store are taken and analysed in detail to explain in detail.","title":"Forecasting demand in brick and motor stores"},{"location":"R/VAR-models/#data","text":"The data used is taken from \"Walmart Recruiting - Store Sales Forecasting data competition\" on Kaggle[2].

We should check if the sales follow a Poisson distribution and model the difference of time between sales using an exponential distribution (which we are not doing in this analysis). 2. Ignoring the smaller cross-correlations between sales of departments. 3. The VAR model has an additive form. This means that the effect of cross-correlations is additive. 4.

This model at a store level is used to predict sales of the departments in the clusters.

The count of stores is added to identify fast-moving departments. There are a total of five types of markdowns that were active across the stores. While the markdowns are not given at the department level, we assume that markdowns affect sales across departments due to cross-correlations. The magnitude of these markdowns is plotted for each store (appendix). This shows that in almost all stores, Markdown 1 is the highest while Markdown 3 is the lowest. From the plots above, we are restricting our analysis to the following departments 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 13, 14, 16, 21, 30, 38, 40, 46, 67, 79, 81, 82, 90, 91, 92, 95 as they are fast-moving. We also observe that there is no visible pattern among the markdowns. This indicates that predicting the markdowns for the past (where we have missing data) would be challenging. The correlations between the total sales of the department's can be visualized in the below correlation plot. These correlations can be used to create clusters of departments that are closely related using hierarchical clustering. Four clusters are created with minimum 3 and maximum 7 departments.

Null value treatment: In the data provided, there are three types of Null values. 1. For temperature, Fuel price, unemployment and CPI index, the null values are replaced with mean values in the store. This is because there is a small deviation of these numbers within a store. Assuming that the mean will be close to the actual number of these variables would be reasonable. These values do not follow a pattern and are random. 2. For markdowns after 11-11-11, null values are replaced with Zero. For markdown data after 11-11-11, any null value is assumed to be present due to no markdowns. 3.

The R^2 metrics are between 32-65% indicating the percentage of demand variation that is explained by the model. Temperature is significant in all the departments. holidays are significant only in departments 10 and 2 while fuel price is not significant in any department. CPI is not-significant in departments 10 and 13 while unemployment is significant in department 2 only. Among markdowns, the first markdown is significant only for departments 10 and 4, the second for 2, 13, 81 and 95, the third and fourth markdowns are not significant, and the fifth one is significant in the department 4. From the significant variables, we can observe the following: 1. Temperature is a good proxy for seasonality. To improve the prediction, classifying temperature into different ranges might help. 2. Departments 10 and 2 have a lot of products that are commonly given as gifts during the holiday seasons. During the holiday season, these departments should be given more focus. 3. The demand for items in departments 10 and 13 is resilient to small changes in inflation and CPI. This could mean that these items might be inelastic. 4. The products in department 2 have higher sales while a customer is unemployed. 5. Not all markdowns affect the sales of different departments. For example, Markdown type 1 is useful to improve the sales of departments 10 and 4 only. More analysis on the nature of markdowns is required to understand the reasons for this trend. Markdowns can be planned more efficiently if these relationships can be analysed further. We can ask questions like \"do markdowns (of type 1) on shoes improve the sales of socks\", and \"Can I create markdowns or discounts with products across departments like a discount if shoes and socks are brought together. The effect of some markdowns is negative in some departments (in presence of other markdowns). This has to also be investigated. Sometimes, providing markdowns for some items can improve the sales in that department/product but cannibalises sales in other departments/products. 6. Department 13 is not influenced by any markdowns, indicating this could be a department of inelastic products. Walmart can relook at the pricing strategy for these items. The demand equation for the demand of department 95 at store 1 is as follows (only significant variables). $$ demand_{95, t} = 0.324\\times \\Delta sales_{10, t-1} + 0.724\\times sales_{2, t-1} -1.169\\times \\Delta sales_{4, t-1} +1.668\\times \\Delta sales_{81, t-1} + 0\\times sales_{95, t-1} + 510\\times temperature_t - 0.383\\times markdown2_{t} + 675.14\\times cpi_{t} -83971$$ From this equation, we can see that sales of products in department 2 in the previous period have a positive impact (if one hundred additional items were sold in the previous period in department 2, 72 additional units will be sold in department 95). Similarly, departments 13 and 81 also have a positive impact on sales. Department 4 has a negative impact on sales (for one additional unit increase in sales in department 4, the sales in the current period decreased by 1.16 units). The previous period demand has no significance (in presence of other variables).","title":"Conclusions"},{"location":"R/VAR-models/#predictions","text":"Finally, using the VAR(1) model, we can predict the demand in each department for different values of markdowns and other exogenous variables.

I want to use a forecasting model developed by Frank Bass that has proven to be effective in forecasting the adoption of innovative and new technologies. I am going to use Nonlinear programming to estimate the parameters of the Bass forecasting model. Bass Forecasting model \u00b6 The model has three parameters that must be estimated. parameter explanation m the number of people estimated to eventually adopt the new product q the coefficient of imitation p the coefficient of innovation The coefficient of imitation (q) is a parameter that measures the likelihood of adoption due to a potential adopter being influenced by someone who has already adopted the product. It measures the \u201cword-of-mouth\u201d effect influencing purchases. The coefficient of innovation (p) measures the likelihood of adoption, assuming no influence from someone who has already purchased (adopted) the product. It is the likelihood of someone adopting the product due to her or his own interest in the innovation. If \\(C_{t-1}\\) is the number of people that adopted the product by time t-1, then the number of new adopters during time t is given by Bass forecasting model, and it is: $$ F_t = (p + q[\\frac{C_{t-1}}{m}])(m-C_{t-1}) $$ Data \u00b6 The data of iPhone sales is taken from Statista . A sample of the data is shown below. iPhone sales (Millions $) Quarter Sales Q2 '15 61.17 Q3 '18 41.30 Q4 '18 46.89 Q2 '11 18.65 Q4 '16 45.51 The sales of iPhone in different quarters can be plotted as follows: Strictly speaking, iPhone sales for time period t are not the same as the number of adopters during time period t. But the number of repeat customers is usually small and iPhone sales is proportional to the number of customers. The Bass forecasting model seems appropriate here. This forecasting model, can be incorporated into a nonlinear optimization problem to find the values of p, q, and m that give the best forecasts for this set of data. Assume that N periods of data are available. Let \\(S_t\\) denote the actual number of adopters in period t for t = 1, . . . , N. Then the forecast in each period and the corresponding forecast error \\(E_t\\) is defined by $$ F_t = (p + q[\\frac{C_{t-1}}{m}])(m-C_{t-1}) = pm + (q-p)C_{t-1} - q\\frac{C_{t-1}^2}{m} $$ this can be written as \\(\\begin{eqnarray} F(t) &=& \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\; C_{t-1} + \\beta_2 \\; C_{t-1}^2 \\quad (BASS) \\\\ \\beta_0 &=& pm \\\\ \\beta_1 &=& q-p \\\\ \\beta_2 &=& -q/m \\end{eqnarray}\\) Where $$ E_t = F_t - S_t$$ Minimizing the sum of squares of errors gives me the p, q and m values.

For simplicity\u2019s sake, I want to concentrate on three zones, Bangalore-east, Mahadevpura and Rajeshwari Nagar. As I want to test that there is significant difference between unemployment rate in different zones in Bangalore, the null and alternate hypothesis will be as follows: $$ H_0: \\mu_{Bangalore-east} = \\mu_{Mahadevpura} = \\mu_{Rajeshwari-Nagar} $$ $$ H_1: Not\\, all\\, \\mu\\, are\\, equal $$ Sample unemployment data set: Sample Data cityName zoneName wardName wardNo unemployed.no employed.no total.labour rate Bengaluru East Manorayana Palya 167 19011 13745 32756 0.5803822 Bengaluru East Ganga Nagar 154 18294 14346 32640 0.5604779 Bengaluru Mahadevapura Basavanapura 187 27146 22061 49207 0.5516695 Bengaluru Mahadevapura Ramamurthy Nagar 26 27085 20273 47358 0.5719203 Bengaluru East Radhakrishna Temple Ward 18 20081 15041 35122 0.5717499 Visualizing the difference of unemployment in each zone. ggplot ( unemployment , aes ( x = zoneName , y = rate , group = zoneName )) + geom_boxplot () + labs ( x = 'Zone' , y = 'Unemployment %' ) + theme_minimal () The summary statistics of unemployment across different zones are as follows: data.summary <- unemployment %>% rename ( group = zoneName ) %>% group_by ( group ) %>% summarise ( count = n (), mean = mean ( rate ), sd = sd ( rate ), skewness = skewness ( rate ), kurtosis = kurtosis ( rate )) data.summary ## # A tibble: 3 x 6 ## group count mean sd skewness kurtosis ## <chr> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> ## 1 East 81 0.574 0.0361 -0.228 0.747 ## 2 Mahadevapura 24 0.567 0.0449 -0.812 1.69 ## 3 Rajarajeswari Nagar 18 0.548 0.0499 0.00421 -1.24 From the above table I observe that the unemployment rate is between 54% and 57% in all the three zones. One of the conditions to perform anova is that the population response variable follows a normal distribution in each group. The distribution of unemployment rate in different zones are: ggplot () + geom_density ( data = unemployment , aes ( x = rate , group = zoneName , color = zoneName ), adjust = 2 ) + labs ( x = 'Unemployment Rate' , y = 'Density' , title = 'Testing normality among response variables' ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) From the above graph, it looks like the three groups are normally distributed. To test for normality, we could use Shapiro-Wilk test. The test for each group would have the following hypothesis: \\(H_0\\) : The unemployment rate in the group is normally distributed \\(H_1\\) : The unemployment rate in the group is not normally distributed for ( i in 1 : nrow ( data.summary )){ test.dist <- ( unemployment %>% dplyr :: filter ( zoneName == data.summary $ group [ i ])) $ rate cat ( 'Testing for group ' , data.summary $ group [ i ], '\\n' ) print ( shapiro.test ( test.dist )) norm.plot <- ggplot () + geom_qq ( aes ( sample = test.dist )) + stat_qq_line ( aes ( sample = test.dist )) + ggtitle ( paste0 ( \"Normal distribution Q-Q plot for group \" , data.summary $ group [ i ])) + theme_minimal () plot ( norm.plot ) } ## Testing for group East ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: test.dist ## W = 0.97147, p-value = 0.06734 ## Testing for group Mahadevapura ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: test.dist ## W = 0.90815, p-value = 0.03216 ## Testing for group Rajarajeswari Nagar ## ## Shapiro-Wilk normality test ## ## data: test.dist ## W = 0.95852, p-value = 0.5734 As \\(p > \\alpha\\) , where \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\) , retaining the Null hypothesis in all the three groups. Therefore, we can assume that unemployment rate is normally distributed among all groups. Another condition for anova is that the population variances are assumed to be same. This is an assumption I am willing to take at this point. Taking these assumptions, the ideal distributions of the sample are as follows. These distributions can be compared to a simulation that I created where change in F value (and significance of anova) can be visualised by increasing the between variance (increasing the distance between group means) plot.normal.groups <- function ( data.summary , mean , sd , label , title ){ common.group.sd <- mean ( data.summary $ sd ) range <- seq ( mean -3 * sd , mean +3 * sd , by = sd * 0.001 ) norm.dist <- data.frame ( range = range , dist = dnorm ( x = range , mean = mean , sd = sd )) # Plotting sampling distribution and x_bar value with cutoff norm.aov.plot <- ggplot ( data = norm.dist , aes ( x = range , y = dist )) for ( i in 1 : nrow ( data.summary )) { norm.aov.plot <- norm.aov.plot + stat_function ( fun = dnorm , color = colors ()[ sample ( 50 : 100 , 1 )], size = 1 , args = list ( mean = data.summary $ mean [ i ], sd = common.group.sd )) } norm.aov.plot + labs ( x = label , y = 'Density' , title = title ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) } set.seed ( 9 ) mean <- mean ( unemployment $ rate ) sd <- sd ( unemployment $ rate ) plot.normal.groups ( data.summary , mean , sd , 'Travel time (sec)' , 'Assuming normality among response variables' ) Performing Anova with $$ H_0: \\mu_{Bangalore-east} = \\mu_{Mahadevpura} = \\mu_{Rajeshwari-Nagar} $$ $$ H_1: Not\\, all\\, \\mu\\, are\\, equal $$ # Functions used in anova-test f.plot <- function ( pop.mean = 0 , alpha = 0.05 , f , df1 , df2 , label = 'F distribution' , title = 'Anova test' ){ # Creating a sample F distribution range <- seq ( qf ( 0.0001 , df1 , df2 ), qf ( 0.9999 , df1 , df2 ), by = ( qf ( 0.9999 , df1 , df2 ) - qf ( 0.0001 , df1 , df2 )) * 0.001 ) f.dist <- data.frame ( range = range , dist = df ( x = range , ncp = pop.mean , df1 = df1 , df2 = df2 )) %>% dplyr :: mutate ( H0 = if_else ( range <= qf ( p = 1 - alpha , ncp = pop.mean , df1 = df1 , df2 = df2 ), 'Retain' , 'Reject' )) # Plotting sampling distribution and F value with cutoff plot.test <- ggplot ( data = f.dist , aes ( x = range , y = dist )) + geom_area ( aes ( fill = H0 )) + scale_color_manual ( drop = TRUE , values = c ( 'Retain' = \"#00BFC4\" , 'Reject' = \"#F8766D\" ), aesthetics = 'fill' ) + geom_vline ( xintercept = f , size = 2 ) + geom_text ( aes ( x = f , label = paste0 ( 'F = ' , round ( f , 3 )), y = mean ( dist )), colour = \"blue\" , vjust = 1.2 ) + labs ( x = label , y = 'Density' , title = title ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) plot ( plot.test ) } anva <- aov ( rate ~ zoneName , unemployment ) anova.summary <- summary ( anva ) print ( anova.summary ) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) ## zoneName 2 0.01065 0.005323 3.315 0.0397 * ## Residuals 120 0.19269 0.001606 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1 f.plot ( f = anova.summary [[ 1 ]] $ F [ 1 ], df1 = anova.summary [[ 1 ]] $ Df [ 1 ], df2 = anova.summary [[ 1 ]] $ Df [ 2 ]) Here \\(p < \\alpha\\) , where \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\) Hence rejecting the Null Hypothesis.

These two beers are combined into one cluster and the centroid of the cluster is considered as a point for the next step. The next two closest points/clusters are combined to form a bigger cluster and this continues till all the points are clustered into one big cluster. Dendrogram \u00b6 Dendrogram is a pictorial representation of merging of various cases as the Euclidean distance is increased. The distance is rescaled to a scale between 0 and 4. By drawing a vertical line at different values of re-scaled distance, one can identify the clusters. The dendrogram for beer dataset is shown below. From the above plot, we can observe that Coors and Hamms were the closest and thus were clustered first. Then Srohs_bohemian_style and Heilemans_Old_Style were merged into one cluster Subsequently, the centroid of the coors-hams cluster is close to Schlitz, so all the three beers were clustered And so on until all the beers are finally clustered into one cluster From the above dendrogram, I want to segment customers for effective marketing strategy. How many clusters are ideal? If I take a cut-off of distance 2.5 in the dendrogram, we have 4 clusters, but if I take a smaller 1.5 as cut-off, the number of clusters increases to 12. So 4 (or 5) clusters seems to be an appropriate number of clusters. Let us look at each of the clusters Cluster 1 \u00b6 Cluster 1 contains Becks , Kronenbourg , Heineken and Kirin beers. They are imported brands into the US. They have high alcohol content, low sodium content and high costs. The target customers are brand sensitive, and the brands are promoted as premium brands. Cluster 2 \u00b6 Cluster 2 contains Budweiser , Schlitz , Coors , Hamms , Augsberger etc beers. They have medium alcohol content and medium cost. They are the largest segment of customers. Cluster 3 \u00b6 Cluster 3 contains light beers like Coors_light , Budwiser_light , Miller_lite etc. These are beers with low calorie, low sodium and low alcohol content. The target customers are the customer segment who want to drink but are also health conscious.

It classifies objects in multiple groups (i.e., clusters), such that objects within the same cluster are as similar as possible (low intra-cluster variation), whereas objects from different clusters are as dissimilar as possible (i.e., high inter-cluster variation). In k-means clustering, each cluster is represented by its centre (i.e. centroid). Steps \u00b6 In K-means clustering, the observations in the sample are assigned to one of the clusters by using the following steps: 1. Choose K observations from the data that are likely to be in different clusters 2. The K observations chosen in step 1 are the centroids of those clusters 3. For remaining observations, find the cluster closest to the centroid. Add the new observation (say observation j) to the cluster with the closest centroid 4. Adjust the centroid after adding a new observation to the cluster. The closest centroid is chosen based on an appropriate distance measure 5. Repeat step 3 and 4 till all observations are assigned to a cluster The centroids keep moving when new observations are added. Data \u00b6 The data used in this blog is taken from kaggle.

This can be done using many ways, some of which are: 1. Business decision 2. Calinski and Harabasz index 3. Silhouette statistic 4. Elbow curve Calinski and Harabasz index \u00b6 Calinhara index is an F-statistic kind of index which compares the between and within cluster variances. It is given by: $$ CH(k) = \\frac{B(k)/k-1}{W(k)/(n-k)} $$ Where k is number of clusters and B(k) and W(k) are between and within cluster variances respectively. From the above plot, the ideal k value to be selected is 2. Silhouette statistic \u00b6 Silhouette statistic is the ratio of average distance within the cluster with average distance outside the cluster. If a(i) is the average distance between an observation i and other points in the cluster to which observation i belongs and b(i) is the minimum average distance between observation i and observations in other clusters. Then the Silhouette statistic is defined by $$ S(i) = (\\frac{b(i)-a(i)}{Max[a(i), b(i)]})$$ The ideal k using silhouette 2 to 6 as there is not much reduction in silhouette metric. Elbow curve \u00b6 Elbow curve is based on within-cluster variation. The location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters. (see blog on hierarchical clustering for more) fviz_nbclust ( cluster_data , kmeans , method = \"wss\" ) From the above three metrics, the optimum value of k is 3. Analysing the cluster \u00b6 K-means can be computed in R with the kmeans function. We will group the data into three clusters (centres = 3). The kmeans function also has a nstart option that attempts multiple initial configurations and reports on the best one. For example, adding nstart = 25 will generate 25 initial configurations. This approach is often recommended. final_cluster <- kmeans ( cluster_data , centers = 3 , nstart = 25 ) The final clusters can be visualized below. In the below figure, all the columns are reduced to two columns for visualization using PCA. In each column, the variation between the three clusters can be analysed using the following plots. From the comparison plot, we can observe the properties of the three clusters. They are: Cluster 1 \u00b6 They are customers who purchase lesser amounts using the card but have reasonably high balance in their account. Cluster 2 \u00b6 They are customers who have a low balance in their account and also purchase less using the account.

Please visit the link for the data description and problem statement. In particular, in this blog I want to use Logistic regression for the analysis. A sample of the data is given below: ## # A tibble: 5 x 8 ## Survived Pclass Sex Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked ## <fct> <fct> <fct> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <fct> ## 1 O 3 female 43 1 6 46.9 S ## 2 O 2 male 54 0 0 26 S ## 3 O 2 male 33 0 0 12.3 S ## 4 O 3 male 25 0 0 7.23 C ## 5 O 3 female 2 0 1 10.5 S The summary statistics for the data is: ## Survived Pclass Sex Age SibSp ## I:340 1:214 female:312 Min. : 0.42 Min. :0.0000 ## O:549 2:184 male :577 1st Qu.:22.00 1st Qu.:0.0000 ## 3:491 Median :28.05 Median :0.0000 ## Mean :29.59 Mean :0.5242 ## 3rd Qu.:36.00 3rd Qu.:1.0000 ## Max. :80.00 Max. :8.0000 ## Parch Fare Embarked ## Min. :0.0000 Min. : 0.000 C:168 ## 1st Qu.:0.0000 1st Qu.: 7.896 Q: 77 ## Median :0.0000 Median : 14.454 S:644 ## Mean :0.3825 Mean : 32.097 ## 3rd Qu.:0.0000 3rd Qu.: 31.000 ## Max. :6.0000 Max. :512.329 Data Cleaning and EDA \u00b6 Zero and Near Zero Variance features do not explain any variance in the predictor variable. nearZeroVar ( raw_df , saveMetrics = TRUE ) ## freqRatio percentUnique zeroVar nzv ## Survived 1.614706 0.2249719 FALSE FALSE ## Pclass 2.294393 0.3374578 FALSE FALSE ## Sex 1.849359 0.2249719 FALSE FALSE ## Age 1.111111 16.0854893 FALSE FALSE ## SibSp 2.899522 0.7874016 FALSE FALSE ## Parch 5.728814 0.7874016 FALSE FALSE ## Fare 1.023810 27.7840270 FALSE FALSE ## Embarked 3.833333 0.3374578 FALSE FALSE There are no near zero or zero variance columns Similarly, I can check for linearly dependent columns among the continuous variables. feature_map <- unlist ( lapply ( raw_df , is.numeric )) findLinearCombos (( raw_df [, feature_map ])) ## $linearCombos ## list() ## ## $remove ## NULL There are no linearly dependent columns. Uni-variate analysis \u00b6 Now, I want to do some basic EDA on each column. On each continuous column, I want to visually check the following: 1. Variation in the column 2. Its distribution 3. Any outliers 4. q-q plot with normal distribution cont_univ_df <- raw_df %>% select_if ( is.numeric ) %>% mutate ( row_no = as.numeric ( rownames ( raw_df ))) for ( column in colnames ( cont_univ_df [ - ncol ( cont_univ_df )])){ p1 <- ggplot ( cont_univ_df , aes_string ( x = 'row_no' , y = column )) + geom_point ( show.legend = FALSE ) + labs ( x = 'Univariate plot' , y = column ) + ggtitle ( column ) + theme_minimal () # Cumulative plot legendcols <- c ( \"Normal distribution\" = \"darkred\" , \"Density\" = \"darkBlue\" , \"Histogram\" = \"lightBlue\" ) p2 <- ggplot ( cont_univ_df , aes_string ( x = column )) + geom_histogram ( aes ( y = ..density.. , fill = \"Histogram\" ), bins = 50 ) + stat_function ( fun = dnorm , aes ( color = \"Normal distribution\" ), size = 1 , args = list ( mean = mean ( cont_univ_df [[ column ]]), sd = sd ( cont_univ_df [[ column ]]))) + geom_density ( aes ( y = ..density.. , color = \"Density\" ), size = 1 ) + scale_colour_manual ( name = \"Distribution\" , values = legendcols ) + scale_fill_manual ( name = \"Bar\" , values = legendcols ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"none\" ) p3 <- ggplot ( cont_univ_df %>% mutate ( constant = column ), aes_string ( x = \"constant\" , y = column , group = 123 )) + geom_boxplot () + labs ( y = column ) + theme_minimal () p4 <- ggplot ( cont_univ_df , aes_string ( sample = column )) + stat_qq () + stat_qq_line () + theme_minimal () grid.arrange ( p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 , nrow = 2 ) } For categorical variables, I want to look at the frequencies. univ_cat_df <- raw_df %>% select_if ( function ( col ) { is.factor ( col ) | is.character ( col )}) for ( column in colnames ( univ_cat_df )){ plot ( ggplot ( univ_cat_df , aes_string ( column )) + geom_bar () + coord_flip () + ggtitle ( column ) + theme_minimal ()) } From the above plot I infer that the data is unbalanced. But it might not be a problem as the unbalance ratio is less than 2:1. Bi variate analysis \u00b6 I want to understand the relationship of each continuous variable with the \\(y\\) variable. I will achieve that by doing the following: 1. Plot box plot for each of the variables to do a visual comparison between the groups 2. Plot the explanatory variable distribution for both the variables to understand the variability uniquely explained (The non-intersecting part of the blue and the pink is the variation explained by the variable) 3. Predict using Logistic regression using the variable alone to observe the decrease in deviation/AIC 4. Plot Lorenz curve to compute Gini coefficient if applicable (high Gini coefficient means that high inequality is caused by the column, which means more explain-ability) library ( gglorenz ) library ( ineq ) plot_bivariate_cont <- function ( raw_data , pred_column_name ){ bi_var_df <- raw_df %>% select_if ( is.numeric ) for ( column in colnames ( bi_var_df )){ p1 <- ggplot ( raw_df , aes_string ( x = pred_column_name , y = column , group = pred_column_name )) + geom_boxplot () + labs ( y = column ) + ggtitle ( column ) + theme_minimal () p2 <- ggplot ( raw_df , aes_string ( x = column , fill = pred_column_name )) + geom_histogram ( alpha = 0.5 , position = \"identity\" ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) grid.arrange ( p1 , p2 , nrow = 1 , widths = c ( 1 , 2 )) trainList_bi <- createDataPartition ( y = unlist ( raw_df [ pred_column_name ]), times = 1 , p = 0.8 , list = FALSE ) dfTest_bi <- raw_df [ - trainList_bi ,] dfTrain_bi <- raw_df [ trainList_bi ,] form_2 = as.formula ( paste0 ( pred_column_name , ' ~ ' , column )) set.seed ( 1234 ) objControl <- trainControl ( method = \"none\" , summaryFunction = twoClassSummary , # sampling = 'smote', classProbs = TRUE ) cont_loop_caret_model <- train ( form_2 , data = dfTrain_bi , method = 'glm' , trControl = objControl , metric = \"ROC\" ) print ( summary ( cont_loop_caret_model )) if ( sum ( raw_df [ column ] < 0 ) == 0 ){ plot ( ggplot ( raw_df , aes_string ( column )) + gglorenz :: stat_lorenz ( color = \"red\" ) + geom_abline ( intercept = 0 , slope = 1 , color = 'blue' ) + theme_minimal ()) print ( paste0 ( 'Gini coefficient = ' , Gini ( unlist ( raw_df [ column ])))) } print ( strrep ( \"-\" , 100 )) } } plot_bivariate_cont ( raw_df , pred_column_name = 'Survived' ) ## ## Call: ## NULL ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.5682 -1.3694 0.9455 0.9906 1.0696 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

From the box plot I observe that age and sibsp might not be significant factors. The same is reflected in the Walds p-value in the logistic regression. On the other hand, the Gini coefficient is high for SibSp 2. Parch and Fare might be significant as I can observe a significant difference in the box plots. I want to understand the relationship of each categorical variable with the \\(y\\) variable. I will achieve that by doing the following: 1. A mosaic plot shows if any column is significantly different from base column 2.

Passenger class and fare are negatively correlated (obvious). 2. Pclass and sex are two variables that have good correlation with the y variable(survived). Initial Model Training \u00b6 For my initial model, I am training using step wise logistic regression. In every step, I want to observe the following: 1. What variables are added or removed from the model. The current model pics the column which gives the greatest reduction in AIC. The model stops when the reduction in AIC w.r.t. null is lower than the threshold. 2. Substantial increase/decrease in \\(\\beta\\) or change in its sign (which may be due to collinearity between the dependent variables) modified_df <- raw_df %>% mutate ( Embarked = if_else ( Embarked == 'C' , 'C' , 'S_or_Q' )) trainList <- createDataPartition ( y = modified_df $ Survived , times = 1 , p = 0.8 , list = FALSE ) dfTest <- modified_df [ - trainList ,] dfTrain <- modified_df [ trainList ,] form_2 = as.formula ( paste0 ( 'Survived ~ .' )) set.seed ( 1234 ) objControl <- trainControl ( method = \"none\" , summaryFunction = twoClassSummary , classProbs = TRUE , # sampling = 'smote', savePredictions = TRUE ) model <- train ( form_2 , data = dfTrain , method = 'glmStepAIC' , trControl = objControl , metric = \"ROC\" , direction = 'forward' ) ## Start: AIC=949.02 ## .outcome ~ 1 ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## + Sexmale 1 724.20 728.20 ## + Pclass3 1 885.94 889.94 ## + Fare 1 898.05 902.05 ## + EmbarkedS_or_Q 1 935.34 939.34 ## + Age 1 940.79 944.79 ## + Parch 1 941.94 945.94 ## + Pclass2 1 942.85 946.85 ## <none> 947.02 949.02 ## + SibSp 1 946.05 950.05 ## ## Step: AIC=728.2 ## .outcome ~ Sexmale ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## + Pclass3 1 672.39 678.39 ## + Fare 1 700.99 706.99 ## + SibSp 1 710.98 716.98 ## + EmbarkedS_or_Q 1 714.48 720.48 ## + Parch 1 720.72 726.72 ## + Pclass2 1 721.37 727.37 ## <none> 724.20 728.20 ## + Age 1 723.95 729.95 ## ## Step: AIC=678.39 ## .outcome ~ Sexmale + Pclass3 ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## + Age 1 662.66 670.66 ## + SibSp 1 664.21 672.21 ## + Pclass2 1 664.36 672.36 ## + EmbarkedS_or_Q 1 666.38 674.38 ## + Fare 1 667.83 675.83 ## <none> 672.39 678.39 ## + Parch 1 670.60 678.60 ## ## Step: AIC=670.66 ## .outcome ~ Sexmale + Pclass3 + Age ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## + SibSp 1 646.62 656.62 ## + Pclass2 1 648.58 658.58 ## + EmbarkedS_or_Q 1 656.46 666.46 ## + Parch 1 658.81 668.81 ## + Fare 1 658.83 668.83 ## <none> 662.66 670.66 ## ## Step: AIC=656.62 ## .outcome ~ Sexmale + Pclass3 + Age + SibSp ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## + Pclass2 1 629.48 641.48 ## + Fare 1 638.87 650.87 ## + EmbarkedS_or_Q 1 642.17 654.17 ## <none> 646.62 656.62 ## + Parch 1 646.28 658.28 ## ## Step: AIC=641.48 ## .outcome ~ Sexmale + Pclass3 + Age + SibSp + Pclass2 ## ## Df Deviance AIC ## <none> 629.48 641.48 ## + Fare 1 628.57 642.57 ## + EmbarkedS_or_Q 1 628.68 642.68 ## + Parch 1 628.98 642.98 print ( summary ( model )) ## ## Call: ## NULL ## ## Deviance Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -2.5000 -0.6081 0.4231 0.6178 2.6988 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

These factors are significant factors for building the model. Hosmer Lemeshow test is a chi-square goodness of fit test to check if the logistic regression model fits the data. The Null hypothesis is that the model fits the data. library ( ResourceSelection ) dfTrain $ pred_probability_I <- ( predict ( object = model , dfTrain , type = 'prob' )) $ I dfTrain $ pred_probability_O <- ( predict ( object = model , dfTrain , type = 'prob' )) $ O dfTrain $ predictions <- ifelse ( dfTrain $ pred_probability_I >= 0.5 , 1 , 0 ) dfTrain $ binary <- ifelse ( dfTrain $ Survived == 'I' , 1 , 0 ) hoslem.test ( dfTrain $ predictions , dfTrain $ binary , g = 10 ) ## ## Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit (GOF) test ## ## data: dfTrain$predictions, dfTrain$binary ## X-squared = 1.9275, df = 8, p-value = 0.9832 Since the p-value is greater than \\(\\alpha=0.05\\) I accept the null hypothesis that the logistic regression fits the data. Checking for outliers: \u00b6 A simple residual plot can be useful to check outliers. library ( arm ) binnedplot ( fitted ( model $ finalModel ), residuals ( model $ finalModel , type = \"response\" ), nclass = NULL , xlab = \"Expected Values\" , ylab = \"Average residual\" , main = \"Binned residual plot\" , cex.pts = 0.8 , col.pts = 1 , col.int = \"gray\" ) The grey lines represent \u00b1 2 \\(\\sigma\\) bands, which we would expect to contain about 95% of the observations. This model does look reasonable as the majority of the fitted values seem to fall inside the SE bands and are randomly distributed. The Mahalanobis distance gives the distance between the observation and the centroid of the values. A Mahalanobis distance of greater than the chi-square critical value where the degrees of freedom are equal to number of independent variables is considered as a highly influential variable. maha.df <- dfTrain %>% dplyr :: select ( Age , SibSp ) maha.df $ maha <- mahalanobis ( maha.df , colMeans ( maha.df ), cov ( maha.df )) maha.df <- maha.df %>% arrange ( - maha ) %>% mutate ( is.outlier = if_else ( maha > 12 , TRUE , FALSE )) ggplot ( maha.df , aes ( y = Age , x = SibSp , color = is.outlier )) + geom_point ( show.legend = TRUE ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) Although the model predicts that certain observations are outliers, I am not doing any outlier treatment as they are observations that I am interested in. Checking for multi collinearity \u00b6 Like in case of linear regression, we should check for multi collinearity in the model. Multi collinearity is given by VIF. VIF above 4 means there is significant multicollinearity. library ( car ) vif ( model $ finalModel ) ## Sexmale Pclass3 Age SibSp Pclass2 ## 1.147666 1.961434 1.446117 1.224168 1.630786 No factor has high multicollinearity(VIF>4). Finding optimal cut-off \u00b6 For finding the optimal cut-off, I am using three methods. 1. Classification plot 2. Youden's Index 3. Cost based approach Classification plot ggplot ( dfTrain , aes ( x = pred_probability_I , fill = Survived )) + geom_histogram ( alpha = 0.5 , position = \"identity\" ) + labs ( x = 'Predicted probability' , y = 'Count' , title = 'Classification plot' , fill = 'Observed Groups' ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) Youden's Index Youdens index can be used to find cut-off when sensitivity and specificity are equally important. It is the point which has minimum distance from ROC curve's (1, 1) point. $$ Youden's\\, Index \\, = \\, \\max_{p} (Sensitivity(p),Specificity(p)-1) $$ library ( ROCR ) lgPredObj <- prediction ( dfTrain $ pred_probability_I , dfTrain $ Survived , label.ordering = c ( 'O' , 'I' )) lgPerfObj <- performance ( lgPredObj , \"tpr\" , \"fpr\" ) plot ( lgPerfObj , main = \"ROC Curve (train data)\" , col = 2 , lwd = 2 ) abline ( a = 0 , b = 1 , lwd = 2 , lty = 3 , col = \"black\" ) It can also be visualized as the point where sensitivity and specificity are the same sens_spec_plot <- function ( actual_value , positive_class_name , negitive_class_name , pred_probability ){ # Initialising Variables specificity <- c () sensitivity <- c () cutoff <- c () for ( i in 1 : 100 ) { predList <- as.factor ( ifelse ( pred_probability >= i / 100 , positive_class_name , negitive_class_name )) specificity [ i ] <- specificity ( predList , actual_value ) sensitivity [ i ] <- sensitivity ( predList , actual_value ) cutoff [ i ] <- i / 100 } df.sens.spec <- as.data.frame ( cbind ( cutoff , specificity , sensitivity )) ggplot ( df.sens.spec , aes ( x = cutoff )) + geom_line ( aes ( y = specificity , color = 'Specificity' )) + geom_line ( aes ( y = sensitivity , color = 'Sensitivity' )) + labs ( x = 'Cutoff p value' , y = 'Sens/Spec' , title = 'Sensitivity-Specificity plot' , fill = 'Plot' ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) } sens_spec_plot ( actual_value = dfTrain $ Survived , positive_class_name = 'I' , negitive_class_name = 'O' , pred_probability = dfTrain $ pred_probability_I ) Cost based approach I want to give penalties for positive and negatives. The optimal cutoff probability is the one which minimizes the total penalty cost, given by: $$ \\min_p[C_{01}P_{01} + C_{10}P_{10}] $$ For example, if I want to give 3 times the importance to predicting survived when compared to not survived, the cost table is: ## act I act O ## pred I 0 3 ## pred O 1 0 For both the above approaches, the cut-off is: find_p_cutoff <- function ( actual_value , positive_class_name , negitive_class_name , pred_probability , p_01 = 1 , p_10 = 1 ){ # Initialising Variables msclaf_cost <- c () youden_index <- c () cutoff <- c () P00 <- c () #correct classification of negative as negative (Sensitivity) P01 <- c () #misclassification of negative class to positive class (actual is 0, predicted 1) P10 <- c () #misclassification of positive class to negative class (actual 1 predicted 0) P11 <- c () #correct classification of positive as positive (Specificity) costs = matrix ( c ( 0 , p_01 , p_10 , 0 ), ncol = 2 ) for ( i in 1 : 100 ) { predList <- as.factor ( ifelse ( pred_probability >= i / 100 , positive_class_name , negitive_class_name )) tbl <- table ( predList , actual_value ) # Classifying actual no as yes P00 [ i ] <- tbl [ 1 ] / ( tbl [ 1 ] + tbl [ 2 ]) P01 [ i ] <- tbl [ 2 ] / ( tbl [ 1 ] + tbl [ 2 ]) # Classifying actual yes as no P10 [ i ] <- tbl [ 3 ] / ( tbl [ 3 ] + tbl [ 4 ]) P11 [ i ] <- tbl [ 4 ] / ( tbl [ 3 ] + tbl [ 4 ]) cutoff [ i ] <- i / 100 msclaf_cost [ i ] <- P10 [ i ] * costs [ 3 ] + P01 [ i ] * costs [ 2 ] youden_index [ i ] <- P11 [ i ] + P00 [ i ] - 1 } df.cost.table <- as.data.frame ( cbind ( cutoff , P10 , P01 , P11 , P00 , youden_index , msclaf_cost )) cat ( paste0 ( 'The ideal cutoff for:\\n Yodens Index approach : ' , which.max ( df.cost.table $ youden_index ) / 100 )) cat ( paste0 ( '\\n Cost based approach : ' , which.min ( df.cost.table $ msclaf_cost ) / 100 )) ggplot ( df.cost.table , aes ( x = cutoff )) + geom_line ( aes ( y = youden_index , color = 'yoden index' )) + geom_line ( aes ( y = msclaf_cost , color = 'misclassification cost' )) + labs ( x = 'Cutoff p value' , y = 'Index' , title = 'Cutoff p value' , fill = 'Plot' ) + theme_minimal () + theme ( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) } find_p_cutoff ( actual_value = dfTrain $ Survived , positive_class_name = 'I' , negitive_class_name = 'O' , pred_probability = dfTrain $ pred_probability_I , p_01 = 3 , p_10 = 1 ) ## The ideal cutoff for: ## Yodens Index approach : 0.38 ## Cost based approach : 0.27 I am going to consider a cut-off of 0.38.

The number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix, known as the matrix product, has the number of rows of the first and the number of columns of the second matrix. The product of matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is then denoted simply as \\(AB\\) . - Wikipedia Matrix multiplication is a linear transformation. What does that mean? Consider the matrices \\(A=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1&0\\\\1&1\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right],\\ B\\ =\\ \\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\2\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]\\) \\(A\\times b\\ =\\ 1\\times\\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\1\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]+2\\times\\left[\\begin{matrix}0\\\\1\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1\\\\3\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]\\) What does this mean? This means that the first row of b is multiplied by the first columnin A, and the second row in b is multiplied by the second column in A. Visually it means that the points [1,0] and [0,1] are shifted to [1,1] and [0,1] in the x-y coordinate system. The new x-axis is the line which runs from [0,0] to [1,1] with unit amount at [1,1]. The new y-axis remains the same at [0,1]. After multiplying, the result is the coordinates of the vector b in the new coordinate system. Refer to this video for a more visual explanation.

We can see that in the identity matrix, the axes are not shifted. Therefore the multiplication of any matrix with I gives itself. The identity matrix in 2x2 is \\(I = \\left[\\begin{matrix}1&0\\\\0&1\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]\\) Transpose of a matrix \u00b6 The transpose of a matrix has the rows and columns transposed or interchanged. t ( A ) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 1 ## [2,] 0 1 t ( b ) ## [,1] [,2] ## [1,] 1 2 The inner product of two matrices can be written as a product of one of the transposes. \\(U.V = U^T \\times V\\) The transpose of a product \\((AB)^T = B^T A^T\\) Range, Rank and fundamental spaces \u00b6 The range of a matrix is the set of vectors that can be obtained as a linear combination of the columns of A. We can call the range of the matrix as the span of all the column vectors. The dimension of the subspace created by this linear combination is the rank of the matrix. Consider two examples: \\(A=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1&0\\\\1&1\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right], C=\\left[\\begin{matrix}1&2\\\\0&0\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]\\) \\(A\\times x\\) spans the whole \\(R^2\\) space as the two column vectors \\(a_1 = [1,1]\\) and \\(a_2=[0,1]\\) are linearly independent. On the other hand, \\(C\\times x\\) gives us a straight line on the x-axis. \\(\\left[\\begin{matrix}1&2\\\\0&0\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right] \\times \\left[\\begin{matrix}x_1\\\\x_2\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right] = \\left[\\begin{matrix}x_1+2x_2\\\\0\\\\\\end{matrix}\\right]\\) The matrix C spans a straight line only. The range for matrix c are the vectors on the x-axis, and the rank is one, which is the dimension of a line. The column rank of \\(A \\in R^{mxn}\\) is the maximum number of linearly independent columns, and the row rank is the maximum number of linearly independent rows. The column rank is the size of the basis of \\(A\\) , and the row rank is the size of the basis for \\(A^T\\) .

I want to explain what is multicollinearity and how and when to tackle it. Collinearity \u00b6 Collinearity is a linear association between two variables. Two variables are perfectly collinear if there is an exact linear relationship between them. For example, \\({\\displaystyle X_{1}}\\) and \\({\\displaystyle X_{2}}\\) are perfectly collinear if there exist parameters \\({\\displaystyle \\lambda _{0}}\\) and \\({\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}}\\) such that, for all observations i, we have $$ X_{2i} = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_1 X_{1i} $$ Here \\({\\displaystyle \\lambda _{1}}\\) can be considered as the slope of the equation and \\({\\displaystyle \\lambda _{0}}\\) is the intercept. Correlation \u00b6 Correlation is a numerical measure. It measures how close two variables are having a linear relationship with each other. The most popular form of correlation coefficient is the Pearson's coefficient( \\(r_{xy}\\) ). Pearson's product-moment coefficient \u00b6 It is obtained by dividing the co-variance of the two variables by the product of their standard deviations. \\({\\displaystyle r_{xy}=\\mathrm {corr} (X,Y)={\\mathrm {cov} (X,Y) \\over \\sigma _{X}\\sigma _{Y}} = {\\frac {\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\\bar {x}})(y_{i}-{\\bar {y}})}{(n-1)s_{x}s_{y}}}={\\frac {\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\\bar {x}})(y_{i}-{\\bar {y}})}{\\sqrt {\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-{\\bar {x}})^{2}\\sum \\limits _{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-{\\bar {y}})^{2}}}},}\\) Where x and y are the means of X and Y, and \\(s_{x}, s_{y}\\) are the standard deviations of X and Y. The Pearson correlation is \\(+1\\) in case of a perfect direct(increasing) linear relationship (correlation), \\(-1\\) in the case of a perfect decreasing (inverse) linear relationship(anti-correlation), and some value in the open interval \\((-1, +1)\\) in all other cases, indicating the degree of linear dependence between the variables. As it approaches zero there is less of a relationship(closer to uncorrelated). The closer the coefficient is to either \\(-1\\) or \\(+1\\) , the stronger is the correlation between the variables. If the variables are independent, Pearson's correlation coefficient is 0, but the converse is not true because the correlation coefficient detects only linear dependencies between two variables. For example, suppose the random variable X is symmetrically distributed about zero, and \\(Y = X^{2}\\) . Then Y is completely determined by X, so that X and Y are perfectly dependent, but their correlation is zero. Multicollinearity \u00b6 Multicollinearity occurs when independent variables in a regression model are correlated. This correlation is a problem because independent variables should be independent. If the degree of correlation between variables is high, it can cause problems when I fit the model and interpret the results. A key goal of regression (or classification) analysis is to isolate the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. The interpretation of a regression coefficient is that it represents the mean change in the dependent variable for each 1 unit change in an independent variable when I hold all the other independent variables constant. That last portion is crucial for our discussion about multicollinearity. The idea is that I can change the value of one independent variable and not the others. However, when independent variables are correlated, it indicates that changes in one variable are associated with shifts in another variable. The stronger the correlation, the more difficult it is to change one variable without changing another. It becomes difficult for the model to estimate the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable independently because the independent variables tend to change in unison. What problems do multicollinearity cause? \u00b6 The coefficients become very sensitive to small changes in the model. I will not be able to trust the p-values to identify independent variables that are statistically significant. That said, I need not always fix multicollinearity. Multicollinearity affects the coefficients and p-values, but it does not influence the predictions, precision of the predictions, and the goodness-of-fit statistics. If my primary goal is to make predictions, and I don't need to understand the role of each independent variable, I don't need to reduce severe multicollinearity. In-time analysis problem \u00b6 Now that I have discussed this much, let me continue with the in-time analysis problem . I want to analyse my entry time at office and understand how different factors effect it. Collinearity checks are done after Univariate and multivariate analysis in EDA. One reason for doing so is that now I know how each factor looks like, and as collinearity is only a linear association between two explanatory variables, we can convert our factors to linear after applying some functions on them(log, square root etc). After multivariate analysis , I currently have the factors 1. date (month / week day / season etc) 2. main_activity (means of transport) 3. hours.worked (of the previous day) 4. travelling.time (time it took to travel from house to office) 5. home.addr (the place of residence) 6. diff.out.time (previous day out of office time) Out of these factors, only travelling.time, hours.worked and diff.out.time are continuous variables, so for now I will restrict my analysis to these three factors. The dependent variable is diff.in.time (difference between my actual in time vs policy in-time) Sample Data diff.in.time date main_activity hours.worked travelling.time home.addr diff.out.time -14 2018-10-09 ON_BICYCLE 10.033333 1147.000 New House 76 35 2018-03-30 IN_VEHICLE 9.383333 854.006 Old House -12 31 2018-11-02 ON_FOOT 10.800000 2183.856 New House 77 1 2018-08-03 IN_VEHICLE 9.816667 633.513 Old House 48 22 2018-04-04 IN_VEHICLE 9.266667 1115.000 Old House -6 As a recap on univariate analysis , hours.worked and diff.in.out.time were exponential distributions(while checking for collinearity we should take their log for linear relationships), while travelling.time is close to a normal distribution(with an exponential tails, but let us ignore that for a now) Testing for collinearity \u00b6 One of the most popular tests to check multicollinearity is VIF factor(which will be discussed and calculated in linear regression blog post). What I want to instead do is visually see how the independent factors influence one another. I can do it in two main ways: Correlation matrix \u00b6 A correlation matrix is a table showing correlation coefficients( \\(r_{xy}\\) ) between variables. Each cell in the table shows the correlation between two variables. First I will make a reusable correlation matrix plotting function. corr_matrix_plotting_fxn <- function ( df ){ library ( reshape ) library ( ggplot2 ) # Making a correlation matrix cormat <- round ( cor ( df ), 2 ) # Getting the upper triangular matrix cormat [ upper.tri ( cormat )] <- NA # Melt the correlation data and drop the rows with NA values melted_cormat <- reshape :: melt ( cormat , na.rm = TRUE ) colnames ( melted_cormat ) <- c ( 'Var1' , 'Var2' , 'value' ) melted_cormat <- melted_cormat %>% filter ( ! is.na ( value )) # Plot the corelation matrix ggheatmap <- ggplot ( melted_cormat , aes ( Var2 , Var1 , fill = value )) + geom_tile ( color = \"black\" ) + scale_fill_gradient2 ( low = \"red\" , high = \"green\" , mid = \"white\" , midpoint = 0 , limit = c ( -1 , 1 ), space = \"Lab\" , name = \"Pearson\\nCorrelation\" ) + # theme_minimal()+ # minimal theme theme ( axis.text.x = element_text ( angle = 45 , vjust = 1 , size = 12 , hjust = 1 )) + coord_fixed () + geom_text ( aes ( Var2 , Var1 , label = value ), color = \"black\" , size = 4 ) + theme ( axis.title.x = element_blank (), axis.title.y = element_blank (), panel.grid.major = element_blank (), panel.border = element_blank (), panel.background = element_blank (), axis.ticks = element_blank (), legend.justification = c ( 1 , 0 ), legend.position = c ( 0.6 , 0.7 ), legend.direction = \"horizontal\" ) + guides ( fill = guide_colorbar ( barwidth = 7 , barheight = 1 , title.position = \"top\" , title.hjust = 0.5 )) print ( ggheatmap ) } In the above function, I will just input the data frame with the necessary columns(modified dependent variables) and I will get the plot. # Selecting necessary columns after converting to linear data sets corr.variables <- travel %>% filter ( diff.out.time > -15 ) %>% mutate ( log.hours.worked = log ( hours.worked ), log.diff.out.time = log ( diff.out.time + 15 )) %>% dplyr :: select ( travelling.time , log.hours.worked , log.diff.out.time ) # Plotting the matrix corr_matrix_plotting_fxn ( corr.variables ) I can see that Hours worked in the previous day and the out-time of the previous day are slightly correlated(Which conceptually seems likely). Correlation Network \u00b6 Using a correlation matrix I can only check if two variables are correlated. If multiple variables are correlated, I should use Correlation Network. Even when only two variables are correlated, these plots tell me which variable among the two to keep and which to reject as a dependent variable in our model. library ( \"qgraph\" ) # Legend Names <- c ( 'Travelling time' , 'Hours worked (previous day)' , 'Previous day out time (diff)' ) # Renaming variables (not necessary) colnames ( corr.variables ) <- c ( 'tr' , 'hw' , 'ot' ) cormat <- round ( cor ( corr.variables ), 2 ) qgraph ( cormat , graph = \"pcor\" , layout = \"spring\" , nodeNames = Names , legend.cex = 0.4 ) From this plot, I can see that travelling time is not correlated to any other variable, and among the other two which are correlated, I will pick out time difference as my second variable and reject hours worked.

If my primary goal is to make predictions, and I don't need to understand the role of each independent variable, I don't need to reduce severe multicollinearity.","title":"What problems do multicollinearity cause?"},{"location":"R/multicollinearity/#in-time-analysis-problem","text":"Now that I have discussed this much, let me continue with the in-time analysis problem . I want to analyse my entry time at office and understand how different factors effect it. Collinearity checks are done after Univariate and multivariate analysis in EDA.

I always had a confusion between the two. In this post, I would like to explore the difference between the two and understand how and where they are used. The data and the problem statement along with explanation of the different kinds of correlation coefficients can be found from the textbook Business Analytics: The Science of Data-Driven Decision Making . This post is largely inspired from the Example problem 10.1 found in Multiple linear regression chapter in the book.

I want to see individually how much they will be able to explain the total variance in \\(y\\) . The total proportion of the variation in \\(y\\) explained by \\(x\\) is given by R square value of the regression. The R square and \\(\\beta\\) values for both the independent variables when taken individually are as follows: ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -229572 -80536 -3601 67967 297182 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Similarly, for P, $$ Y = 87740 + 2.527P + \\epsilon_{P} \\qquad Eq(2) $$ where \\(\\epsilon_{P}\\) is the unexplained error due to P From the above outcome, I observe the following: 1. The total proportion of variation in \\(y\\) explained by CTRP and P individually are 28.15% and 35.58% respectively. (From R-square in the above results) 2. The \\(\\beta\\) coefficients of CTRP and P are 4175 and 2.527 respectively. That means for every unit change in CTRP, the revenue increases by 4175 units while for every change in P the revenue increases by 2.527 units. If both CTRP and P are independent, then I would think that if I tried to use both the variables in the model, then 1. The total explainable variation in \\(y\\) should be 28.15 + 35.58 = 63.73%. That means the model's R square should be 0.6373 2. The \\(\\beta\\) coefficients should be same as before Let's build a regression model using both these variables. In this model, the \\(y\\) variable (Revenue R) is explained using P (promotions) and CTRP. The output is shown below. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -125839 -25848 5388 26146 180440 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The total R-squared is 0.8319 which means that the total proportion of variation in \\(y\\) explained is 83.19%. We were expecting a r-squared of 0.6373. Even the \\(\\beta\\) of CTRP is 5932 which was 4175 before. That means that for every one unit change in CTRP, 5932 units of Revenue will change (keeping P constant), instead of 4175 as we thought before. So what is happening here? Consider the following Venn diagram: In the above diagram, the gold color is Y while the cornflower blue is CTRP and firebrick is Promotion. The area in circles show the variation in the variables. The intersection of 2 circles shows the variation explained in one variable by another variable. I want to understand two things. 1. The increase in R squared due to addition of a variable. Assuming that the variable P already exists in the model, I would like to see how adding CTRP will change the R square value 2. How do I get the \\(\\beta\\) value of CTRP in the combined model (Equation 3). The \\(\\beta_{CTRP}\\) is nothing but the change when all other variables are kept constant, in this case when promotion is kept constant Part or semi partial correlation \u00b6 Part of semi partial correlation explains how much additional variation is explained by including a new parameter. If Promotion was already existing in the model, and I introduce CTRP, the variance explained by CTRP alone would be C/(A+E+G+C). To get the same I should remove the 'G' part in the above diagram. That can be achieved by removing the influence of promotion in CTRP and then doing a regression of the remaining part (B + C) with \\(y\\) . The correlation coefficient when effect of other variables are removed from \\(x\\) but not from \\(y\\) is called as semi partial or part correlation coefficient. The result of regression promotion with CTRP is as follows: ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -39.131 -6.563 0.545 7.558 26.869 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

From here I can infer that an additional 50% of the variation in y is explained by adding CTRP variable. This is called as the semi partial or part correlation. The sum of r-squared when p alone is present in the model (variation explained in y due to P (Equation 2) ie: E and G part in the Venn diagram) and the part correlation R-squared when CTRP is added in the model (variation explained only by CTRP removing P ie: C part in Venn diagram) is close to the total R-Squared when both the variables are present in the model(equation 3). Partial correlation \u00b6 I want to understand how much Revenue changes with CTRP keeping Promotions constant ( \\(\\beta_{CTRP}\\) in Equation 3), to do this, I should remove the effect of P from both Y(revenue) and promotion. The correlation coefficient I get from removing the effect of all other variables in both \\(y\\) and \\(x\\) is called partial correlation coefficient. In the above Venn diagram, it is C/(C+A) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -125839 -25848 5388 26146 180440 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The total proportion of the variation in \\(y\\) explained by \\(x\\) is given by R square value of the regression. The R square and \\(\\beta\\) values for both the independent variables when taken individually are as follows: ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -229572 -80536 -3601 67967 297182 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

Similarly, for P, $$ Y = 87740 + 2.527P + \\epsilon_{P} \\qquad Eq(2) $$ where \\(\\epsilon_{P}\\) is the unexplained error due to P From the above outcome, I observe the following: 1. The total proportion of variation in \\(y\\) explained by CTRP and P individually are 28.15% and 35.58% respectively. (From R-square in the above results) 2. The \\(\\beta\\) coefficients of CTRP and P are 4175 and 2.527 respectively. That means for every unit change in CTRP, the revenue increases by 4175 units while for every change in P the revenue increases by 2.527 units. If both CTRP and P are independent, then I would think that if I tried to use both the variables in the model, then 1. The total explainable variation in \\(y\\) should be 28.15 + 35.58 = 63.73%. That means the model's R square should be 0.6373 2. The \\(\\beta\\) coefficients should be same as before Let's build a regression model using both these variables. In this model, the \\(y\\) variable (Revenue R) is explained using P (promotions) and CTRP. The output is shown below. ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = .outcome ~ ., data = dat) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -125839 -25848 5388 26146 180440 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

The total R-squared is 0.8319 which means that the total proportion of variation in \\(y\\) explained is 83.19%. We were expecting a r-squared of 0.6373. Even the \\(\\beta\\) of CTRP is 5932 which was 4175 before. That means that for every one unit change in CTRP, 5932 units of Revenue will change (keeping P constant), instead of 4175 as we thought before. So what is happening here? Consider the following Venn diagram: In the above diagram, the gold color is Y while the cornflower blue is CTRP and firebrick is Promotion. The area in circles show the variation in the variables. The intersection of 2 circles shows the variation explained in one variable by another variable. I want to understand two things. 1. The increase in R squared due to addition of a variable. Assuming that the variable P already exists in the model, I would like to see how adding CTRP will change the R square value 2. How do I get the \\(\\beta\\) value of CTRP in the combined model (Equation 3). The \\(\\beta_{CTRP}\\) is nothing but the change when all other variables are kept constant, in this case when promotion is kept constant","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"R/part-and-partial-corr/#part-or-semi-partial-correlation","text":"Part of semi partial correlation explains how much additional variation is explained by including a new parameter. If Promotion was already existing in the model, and I introduce CTRP, the variance explained by CTRP alone would be C/(A+E+G+C). To get the same I should remove the 'G' part in the above diagram. That can be achieved by removing the influence of promotion in CTRP and then doing a regression of the remaining part (B + C) with \\(y\\) . The correlation coefficient when effect of other variables are removed from \\(x\\) but not from \\(y\\) is called as semi partial or part correlation coefficient.

It is a common technique used to find associations between many variables. It is often used by grocery stores, e-commerce websites, and anyone with large transaction databases. A most common example that we encounter in our daily lives \u2014 Amazon knows what else you want to buy when you order something on their site. Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieli\u0144ski and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. Associate mining in R \u00b6 Michael Hahsler has authored and maintains two very useful R packages relating to association rule mining: the arules package and the arulesViz package. library ( tidyverse ) library ( arulesViz ) library ( arules ) library ( kableExtra ) Data and EDA \u00b6 There\u2019s a public data of buying records in a grocery store.

Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. This post is the first in a series of blogs on time series methods and forecasting. In this blog, we will discuss stationarity, random walk, deterministic drift and other vocabulary which form as foundation to time series: Stochastic processes \u00b6 A random or stochastic process is a collection of random variables ordered in time. It is denoted as \\(Y_t\\) . For example, in-time of an employee is a stochastic process. How is in-time a stochastic process? Consider the in-time on a particular day is 9:00 AM. In theory, the in-time could be any particular value which depends on many factors like traffic, work load, weather etc. The figure 9:00 AM is a particular realization of many such possibilities. Therefore, we can say that in-time is a stochastic process whereas the actual values observed are a particular realization (sample) of the process. Stationary Processes \u00b6 A stochastic process is said to be stationary if the following conditions are met: 1. Mean is constant over time 2. Variance is constant over time 3. Value of the co-variance between two time periods depends only on the distance or gap or lag between the two time periods and not the actual time at which the co variance is computed This type of process is also called weakly stationary, or co variance stationary, or second-order stationary or wide sense stationary process. Written mathematically, the conditions are: $$ Mean: E(Y_t) = \\mu $$ $$ Variance: var(Y_t) = E(Y_t-\\mu)^2 = \\sigma^2 $$ $$ Covariance: \\gamma_k = E[(Y_y - \\mu)(Y_{t+k} - \\mu)] $$ Purely random or white noise process \u00b6 A stochastic process is purely random if it has zero mean, constant variance, and is serially uncorrelated. An example of white noise is the error term in a linear regression which has zero mean, constant standard deviation and no auto-correlation. Simulation \u00b6 For simulating a stationary process, I am creating 100 realizations(samples) and comparing their mean, variance and co-variance. The data for 6 days and 5 realizations is shown: Samples of Stationary process date realization_1 realization_2 realization_25 realization_50 realization_100 1 2021-12-28 0.3409607 0.5713826 0.2313986 0.6050719 0.5335372 2 2021-12-29 0.5554507 0.5244803 0.4288635 0.9073932 0.6350137 3 2021-12-30 0.1281935 0.1139629 0.2330727 0.8417148 0.8781020 10 2022-01-06 0.1901487 0.7607555 0.5620072 0.2611821 0.4575932 15 2022-01-11 0.8317412 0.6043582 0.0995929 0.9609510 0.2208680 30 2022-01-26 0.3612965 0.5961108 0.5965198 0.3048035 0.7668487 The mean, variance and co-variance between the samples (realizations) across are as follows: For a stationary process, the mean, variance and co variance are constant. Non-stationary Processes \u00b6 If a time series is not stationary, it is called a non-stationary time series. In other words, a non-stationary time series will have a time-varying mean or a time-varying variance or both. Random walk, random walk with drift etc are examples of non-stationary processes. Random walk \u00b6 Suppose \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is a white noise error term with mean 0 and variance \\(\u03c3_2\\) . Then the series \\(Y_t\\) is said to be a random walk if $$ Y_t = Y_{t\u22121} + \\epsilon_t $$ In the random walk model, the value of Y at time t is equal to its value at time (t \u2212 1) plus a random shock. For a random walk, $$ Y_1 = Y_0 + \\epsilon_1 $$ $$ Y_2 = Y_1 + \\epsilon_2 = Y_0 + \\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 $$ $$ Y_3 = Y_2 + \\epsilon_3 = Y_0 + \\epsilon_1 + \\epsilon_2 + \\epsilon_3 $$ and so on.. In general we could write $$ Y_t = Y_0 + \\sum \\epsilon_t $$ As $$ E(Y_t) = E(Y_0 + \\sum \\epsilon_t) = Y_0 $$ $$ var(Y_t) = t\\times \\sigma^2 $$ Although the mean is constant with time, the variance is proportional to time. For simulating a random walk process, I am creating 100 realizations(samples) and comparing their mean, variance and co-variance. The data for 6 days of 5 realizations (samples) is shown: Samples of Random walk process date realization_1 realization_2 realization_25 realization_50 realization_100 1 2021-12-28 4.000000 4.0000000 4.000000 4.000000 4.000000 2 2021-12-29 3.215170 4.9727559 4.981838 2.677480 4.209128 3 2021-12-30 2.400451 4.2477385 6.266374 3.249609 5.545876 10 2022-01-06 2.510370 4.1251187 8.500313 4.559066 7.634846 15 2022-01-11 6.286410 5.3430478 9.441353 2.147137 7.098887 30 2022-01-26 2.985008 0.2757552 5.219005 3.402089 4.125985 The mean, variance and covariances between the samples (realizations) across time would look like follows: From the above plot, the mean of Y is equal to its initial, or starting value, which is constant, but as t increases, its variance increases indefinitely, thus violating a condition of stationarity. A random walk process is also called as a unit root process . Random walk with drift \u00b6 If the random walk model predicts that the value at time t will equal the last period's value plus a constant, or drift ( \\(\\delta\\) ), and a white noise term ( \\(\u03b5_t\\) ), then the process is random walk with a drift. $$ Y_t = \\delta + Y_{t\u22121} + \\epsilon_t $$ The mean $$ E(Y_t) = E(Y_0 + \\sum \\epsilon_t + \\delta) = Y_0 + t\\times\\delta $$ so mean is dependent on time and the variance $$ var(Y_t) = t\\times \\sigma^2 $$ is also dependent on time. As random walk with drift violates the conditions of stationary process, it is a non-stationary process.

Unit root stochastic process \u00b6 Unit root stochastic process is another name for Random walk process. A random walk process can be written as $$ Y_t = \\rho \\times Y_{t\u22121} + \\epsilon_t $$ Where \\(\\rho = 1\\) . If \\(|\\rho| < 1\\) then the process represents Markov first order auto regressive model which is stationary. Only for \\(\\rho = 1\\) we get non-stationary. The distribution of mean, variance and co-variance for \\(\\rho =0.5\\) is Deterministic trend process \u00b6 In the above random walk and random walk with drift, the trend component is stochastic in nature. If instead the trend is deterministic in nature, it will follow a deterministic trend process. $$ Y_t = \u03b2_1 + \u03b2_2\\times t + \\epsilon_t$$ In a deterministic trend process, the mean is \\(\u03b2_1 + \u03b2_2\\times t\\) which is proportional with time, but the variance is constant. This type of process is also called as trend seasonality as subtracting mean of \\(Y_t\\) from \\(Y_t\\) will give us a stationary process. This procedure is called de-trending.

What about all possible linear combinations of \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) ? The linear combination of the vector a and b form the entire 2D plane. Vector space is the space in which the vector can exist. A 2D vector, like a or b, will have vector space of \\(R^2\\) and a 3D vector like d=[1,2,3] is in the vector space \\(R^3\\) . Span: The set of all possible linear combinations of vectors is called the span of those set of vectors. For the above two vectors a = [1,2] and b=[1,1], the entire 2d space is the span, as we can get every vector in the 2d space as a linear combination of the two vectors. To explain the difference between vector space and vector span, consider the two vectors d=[1,2,3] and e=[1,1,1] As the two vectors are in 3 dimensions, they have a vector space of 3 or \\(R^3\\) . Adding d+e I get another vector in 3d. d <- c ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) e <- c ( 1 , 1 , 1 ) d + e ## [1] 2 3 4 But what are all the linear combinations for d and e? This forms a 2d plane which goes thru the origin. Therefore these vectors span a plane (in \\(R^2\\) ) although their vector space is ( \\(R^3\\) ).

In the first example with a=[1,2] and b=[1,1], any vectors in the 2d space can be written as a linear combination of a and b. In the second example with d=[1,2,3] and e=[1,1,1], any vector on the plane can be written as a linear combination of d and e. A vector which is not in the plane, like f = [2,3,3] is linearly independent of d and e, as no \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) satisfy \\(f=\\alpha d+\\beta e\\) .

From the above examples, a and b are in the vector space \\(R^2\\) and also have their span as \\(R^2\\) . Therefore they form a basis for \\(R^2\\) . Similarly, the three independent vectors d, e and f are in the vector space \\(R^3\\) and form a basis for \\(R^3\\) . The standard basis for \\(R^2\\) is [1.0] and [0,1].
